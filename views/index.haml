    %h3 SCENE
    %p
      Morning-room in Algernon’s flat in Half-Moon
      Street.  The room is luxuriously and artistically
      furnished.  The sound of a piano is heard in the adjoining
      room.
    %p
      [
      %b Lane
      is arranging afternoon tea on the table, and
      after the music has ceased,
      %b Algernon
      enters.]
    %p
      %b> Algernon.
      \  Did you hear what I was playing,
      Lane?
    %p
      %b> Lane.
      \  I didn’t think it polite to listen,
      sir.
    %p
      %b> Algernon.
      \  I’m sorry for that, for your
      sake.  I don’t play accurately—any one can play
      accurately—but I play with wonderful expression.  As
      far as the piano is concerned, sentiment is my forte.  I
      keep science for Life.
    %p
      %b> Lane.
      \  Yes, sir.
    %p
      %b> Algernon.
      \  And, speaking of the science of Life,
      have you got the cucumber sandwiches cut for Lady Bracknell?
    %p
      %b> Lane.
      \  Yes, sir.  [Hands them on a
      salver.]
    %p
      %b> Algernon.
      \  [Inspects them, takes two, and sits
      down on the sofa.]  Oh! . . . by the way, Lane, I see from
      your book that on Thursday night, when Lord Shoreman and Mr.
      Worthing were dining with me, eight bottles of champagne are
      entered as having been consumed.
    %p
      %b> Lane.
      \  Yes, sir; eight bottles and a pint.
    %p
      %b> Algernon.
      \  Why is it that at a bachelor’s
      establishment the servants invariably drink the champagne? 
      I ask merely for information.
    %p
      %b> Lane.
      \  I attribute it to the superior quality of
      the wine, sir.  I have often observed that in married
      households the champagne is rarely of a first-rate brand.
    %p
      %b> Algernon.
      \  Good heavens!  Is marriage so
      demoralising as that?
    %p
      %b> Lane.
      \  I believe it
      %i is
      a very pleasant
      state, sir.  I have had very little experience of it myself
      up to the present.  I have only been married once. 
      That was in consequence of a misunderstanding between myself and
      a young person.
    %p
      %b> Algernon.
      \  [Languidly
      %i> .
      ]  I don’t
      know that I am much interested in your family life, Lane.
    %p
      %b> Lane.
      \  No, sir; it is not a very interesting
      subject.  I never think of it myself.
    %p
      %b> Algernon.
      \  Very natural, I am sure.  That
      will do, Lane, thank you.
    %p
      %b> Lane.
      \  Thank you, sir.  [
      %b Lane
      goes
      out.]
    %p
      %b> Algernon.
      \  Lane’s views on marriage seem
      somewhat lax.  Really, if the lower orders don’t set
      us a good example, what on earth is the use of them?  They
      seem, as a class, to have absolutely no sense of moral
      responsibility.

    %p
      [
      %b Lane
      goes out
      %i> .
      ]
    %p
      %b> Algernon.
      \  How are you, my dear #{ernest}?  What
      brings you up to town?
    %p
      %b> Jack.
      \  Oh, pleasure, pleasure!  What else
      should bring one anywhere?  Eating as usual, I see,
      Algy!
    %p
      %b> Algernon.
      \  [Stiffly
      %i> .
      ]  I believe it is
      customary in good society to take some slight refreshment at five
      o’clock.  Where have you been since last Thursday?
    %p
      %b> Jack.
      \  [Sitting down on the sofa.]  In the
      country.
    %p
      %b> Algernon.
      \  What on earth do you do there?
    %p
      %b> Jack.
      \  [Pulling off his gloves
      %i> .
      ]  When
      one is in town one amuses oneself.  When one is in the
      country one amuses other people.  It is excessively
      boring.
    %p
      %b> Algernon.
      \  And who are the people you amuse?
    %p
      %b> Jack.
      \  [Airily
      %i> .
      ]  Oh, neighbours,
      neighbours.
    %p
      %b> Algernon.
      \  Got nice neighbours in your part of
      Shropshire?
    %p
      %b> Jack.
      \  Perfectly horrid!  Never speak to one
      of them.
    %p
      %b> Algernon.
      \  How immensely you must amuse
      them!  [Goes over and takes sandwich.]  By the way,
      Shropshire is your county, is it not?
    %p
      %b> Jack.
      \  Eh?  Shropshire?  Yes, of
      course.  Hallo!  Why all these cups?  Why cucumber
      sandwiches?  Why such reckless extravagance in one so
      young?  Who is coming to tea?
    %p
      %b> Algernon.
      \  Oh! merely Aunt Augusta and
      Gwendolen.
    %p
      %b> Jack.
      \  How perfectly delightful!
    %p
      %b> Algernon.
      \  Yes, that is all very well; but I am
      afraid Aunt Augusta won’t quite approve of your being
      here.
    %p
      %b> Jack.
      \  May I ask why?
    %p
      %b> Algernon.
      \  My dear fellow, the way you flirt with
      Gwendolen is perfectly disgraceful.  It is almost as bad as
      the way Gwendolen flirts with you.
    %p
      %b> Jack.
      \  I am in love with Gwendolen.  I have
      come up to town expressly to propose to her.
    %p
      %b> Algernon.
      \  I thought you had come up for pleasure?
      \. . . I call that business.
    %p
      %b> Jack.
      \  How utterly unromantic you are!
    %p
      %b> Algernon.
      \  I really don’t see anything
      romantic in proposing.  It is very romantic to be in
      love.  But there is nothing romantic about a definite
      proposal.  Why, one may be accepted.  One usually is, I
      believe.  Then the excitement is all over.  The very
      essence of romance is uncertainty.  If ever I get married,
      I’ll certainly try to forget the fact.
    %p
      %b> Jack.
      \  I have no doubt about that, dear
      Algy.  The Divorce Court was specially invented for people
      whose memories are so curiously constituted.
    %p
      %b> Algernon.
      \  Oh! there is no use speculating on that
      subject.  Divorces are made in Heaven—[
      %b Jack
      puts out his hand to take a sandwich. 
      %b Algernon
      at
      once interferes.]  Please don’t touch the cucumber
      sandwiches.  They are ordered specially for Aunt
      Augusta.  [Takes one and eats it.]
    %p
      %b> Jack.
      \  Well, you have been eating them all the
      time.
    %p
      %b> Algernon.
      \  That is quite a different matter. 
      She is my aunt.  [Takes plate from below.]  Have some
      bread and butter.  The bread and butter is for
      Gwendolen.  Gwendolen is devoted to bread and butter.
    %p
      %b> Jack.
      \  [Advancing to table and helping
      himself.]  And very good bread and butter it is too.
    %p
      %b> Algernon.
      \  Well, my dear fellow, you need not eat
      as if you were going to eat it all.  You behave as if you
      were married to her already.  You are not married to her
      already, and I don’t think you ever will be.
    %p
      %b> Jack.
      \  Why on earth do you say that?
    %p
      %b> Algernon.
      \  Well, in the first place girls never
      marry the men they flirt with.  Girls don’t think it
      right.
    %p
      %b> Jack.
      \  Oh, that is nonsense!
    %p
      %b> Algernon.
      \  It isn’t.  It is a great
      truth.  It accounts for the extraordinary number of
      bachelors that one sees all over the place.  In the second
      place, I don’t give my consent.
    %p
      %b> Jack.
      \  Your consent!
    %p
      %b> Algernon.
      \  My dear fellow, Gwendolen is my first
      cousin.  And before I allow you to marry her, you will have
      to clear up the whole question of Cecily.  [Rings bell.]
    %p
      %b> Jack.
      \  Cecily!  What on earth do you
      mean?  What do you mean, Algy, by Cecily!  I
      don’t know any one of the name of Cecily.
    %p
      [Enter
      = succeed ".]" do
        %b Lane
    %p
      %b> Algernon.
      \  Bring me that cigarette case Mr.
      Worthing left in the smoking-room the last time he dined
      here.
    %p
      %b> Lane.
      \  Yes, sir.  [
      %b Lane
      goes out.]
    %p
      %b> Jack.
      \  Do you mean to say you have had my
      cigarette case all this time?  I wish to goodness you had
      let me know.  I have been writing frantic letters to
      Scotland Yard about it.  I was very nearly offering a large
      reward.
    %p
      %b> Algernon.
      \  Well, I wish you would offer one. 
      I happen to be more than usually hard up.
    %p
      %b> Jack.
      \  There is no good offering a large reward
      now that the thing is found.
    %p
      [Enter
      %b Lane
      with the cigarette case on a salver. 
      %b Algernon
      takes it at once. 
      %b Lane
      goes
      out.]
    %p
      %b> Algernon.
      \  I think that is rather mean of you,
      #{ernest}, I must say.  [Opens case and examines it.] 
      However, it makes no matter, for, now that I look at the
      inscription inside, I find that the thing isn’t yours after
      all.
    %p
      %b> Jack.
      \  Of course it’s mine.  [Moving to
      him.]  You have seen me with it a hundred times, and you
      have no right whatsoever to read what is written inside.  It
      is a very ungentlemanly thing to read a private cigarette
      case.
    %p
      %b> Algernon.
      \  Oh! it is absurd to have a hard and
      fast rule about what one should read and what one
      shouldn’t.  More than half of modern culture depends
      on what one shouldn’t read.
    %p
      %b> Jack.
      \  I am quite aware of the fact, and I
      don’t propose to discuss modern culture.  It
      isn’t the sort of thing one should talk of in
      private.  I simply want my cigarette case back.
    %p
      %b> Algernon.
      \  Yes; but this isn’t your
      cigarette case.  This cigarette case is a present from some
      one of the name of Cecily, and you said you didn’t know any
      one of that name.
    %p
      %b> Jack.
      \  Well, if you want to know, Cecily happens
      to be my aunt.
    %p
      %b> Algernon.
      \  Your aunt!
    %p
      %b> Jack.
      \  Yes.  Charming old lady she is,
      too.  Lives at Tunbridge Wells.  Just give it back to
      me, Algy.
    %p
      %b> Algernon.
      \  [Retreating to back of sofa.]  But
      why does she call herself little Cecily if she is your aunt and
      lives at Tunbridge Wells?  [Reading.]  ‘From
      little Cecily with her fondest love.’
    %p
      %b> Jack.
      \  [Moving to sofa and kneeling upon
      it.]  My dear fellow, what on earth is there in that? 
      Some aunts are tall, some aunts are not tall.  That is a
      matter that surely an aunt may be allowed to decide for
      herself.  You seem to think that every aunt should be
      exactly like your aunt!  That is absurd!  For
      Heaven’s sake give me back my cigarette case. 
      [Follows
      %b Algernon
      round the room.]
    %p
      %b> Algernon.
      \  Yes.  But why does your aunt call
      you her uncle?  ‘From little Cecily, with her fondest
      love to her dear Uncle Jack.’  There is no objection,
      I admit, to an aunt being a small aunt, but why an aunt, no
      matter what her size may be, should call her own nephew her
      uncle, I can’t quite make out.  Besides, your name
      isn’t Jack at all; it is #{ernest}.
    %p
      %b> Jack.
      \  It isn’t #{ernest}; it’s Jack.
    %p
      %b> Algernon.
      \  You have always told me it was
      #{ernest}.  I have introduced you to every one as #{ernest}. 
      You answer to the name of #{ernest}.  You look as if your name
      was #{ernest}.  You are the most #{ernest}-looking person I ever
      saw in my life.  It is perfectly absurd your saying that
      your name isn’t #{ernest}.  It’s on your
      cards.  Here is one of them.  [Taking it from
      case.]  ‘Mr. #{ernest} Worthing, B. 4, The
      Albany.’  I’ll keep this as a proof that your
      name is #{ernest} if ever you attempt to deny it to me, or to
      Gwendolen, or to any one else.  [Puts the card in his
      pocket.]
    %p
      %b> Jack.
      \  Well, my name is #{ernest} in town and Jack in
      the country, and the cigarette case was given to me in the
      country.
    %p
      %b> Algernon.
      \  Yes, but that does not account for the
      fact that your small Aunt Cecily, who lives at Tunbridge Wells,
      calls you her dear uncle.  Come, old boy, you had much
      better have the thing out at once.
    %p
      %b> Jack.
      \  My dear Algy, you talk exactly as if you
      were a dentist.  It is very vulgar to talk like a dentist
      when one isn’t a dentist.  It produces a false
      impression.
    %p
      %b> Algernon.
      \  Well, that is exactly what dentists
      always do.  Now, go on!  Tell me the whole thing. 
      I may mention that I have always suspected you of being a
      confirmed and secret Bunburyist; and I am quite sure of it
      now.
    %p
      %b> Jack.
      \  Bunburyist? What on earth do you mean by a
      Bunburyist?
    %p
      %b> Algernon.
      \  I’ll reveal to you the meaning of
      that incomparable expression as soon as you are kind enough to
      inform me why you are #{ernest} in town and Jack in the country.
    %p
      %b> Jack.
      \  Well, produce my cigarette case first.
    %p
      %b> Algernon.
      \  Here it is.  [Hands cigarette
      case.]  Now produce your explanation, and pray make it
      improbable.  [Sits on sofa.]
    %p
      %b> Jack.
      \  My dear fellow, there is nothing improbable
      about my explanation at all.  In fact it’s perfectly
      ordinary.  Old Mr. Thomas Cardew, who adopted me when I was
      a little boy, made me in his will guardian to his grand-daughter,
      Miss Cecily Cardew.  Cecily, who addresses me as her uncle
      from motives of respect that you could not possibly appreciate,
      lives at my place in the country under the charge of her
      admirable governess, Miss Prism.
    %p
      %b> Algernon.
      \  Where is that place in the country, by
      the way?
    %p
      %b> Jack.
      \  That is nothing to you, dear boy.  You
      are not going to be invited . . . I may tell you candidly that
      the place is not in Shropshire.
    %p
      %b> Algernon.
      \  I suspected that, my dear fellow! 
      I have Bunburyed all over Shropshire on two separate
      occasions.  Now, go on.  Why are you #{ernest} in town and
      Jack in the country?
    %p
      %b> Jack.
      \  My dear Algy, I don’t know whether
      you will be able to understand my real motives.  You are
      hardly serious enough.  When one is placed in the position
      of guardian, one has to adopt a very high moral tone on all
      subjects.  It’s one’s duty to do so.  And
      as a high moral tone can hardly be said to conduce very much to
      either one’s health or one’s happiness, in order to
      get up to town I have always pretended to have a younger brother
      of the name of #{ernest}, who lives in the Albany, and gets into the
      most dreadful scrapes.  That, my dear Algy, is the whole
      truth pure and simple.
    %p
      %b> Algernon.
      \  The truth is rarely pure and never
      simple.  Modern life would be very tedious if it were
      either, and modern literature a complete impossibility!
    %p
      %b> Jack.
      \  That wouldn’t be at all a bad
      thing.
    %p
      %b> Algernon.
      \  Literary criticism is not your forte,
      my dear fellow.  Don’t try it.  You should leave
      that to people who haven’t been at a University.  They
      do it so well in the daily papers.  What you really are is a
      Bunburyist.  I was quite right in saying you were a
      Bunburyist.  You are one of the most advanced Bunburyists I
      know.
    %p
      %b> Jack.
      \  What on earth do you mean?
    %p
      %b> Algernon.
      \  You have invented a very useful younger
      brother called #{ernest}, in order that you may be able to come up
      to town as often as you like.  I have invented an invaluable
      permanent invalid called Bunbury, in order that I may be able to
      go down into the country whenever I choose.  Bunbury is
      perfectly invaluable.  If it wasn’t for
      Bunbury’s extraordinary bad health, for instance, I
      wouldn’t be able to dine with you at Willis’s
      to-night, for I have been really engaged to Aunt Augusta for more
      than a week.
    %p
      %b> Jack.
      \  I haven’t asked you to dine with me
      anywhere to-night.
    %p
      %b> Algernon.
      \  I know.  You are absurdly careless
      about sending out invitations.  It is very foolish of
      you.  Nothing annoys people so much as not receiving
      invitations.
    %p
      %b> Jack.
      \  You had much better dine with your Aunt
      Augusta.
    %p
      %b> Algernon.
      \  I haven’t the smallest intention
      of doing anything of the kind.  To begin with, I dined there
      on Monday, and once a week is quite enough to dine with
      one’s own relations.  In the second place, whenever I
      do dine there I am always treated as a member of the family, and
      sent down with either no woman at all, or two.  In the third
      place, I know perfectly well whom she will place me next to,
      to-night.  She will place me next Mary Farquhar, who always
      flirts with her own husband across the dinner-table.  That
      is not very pleasant.  Indeed, it is not even decent . . .
      and that sort of thing is enormously on the increase.  The
      amount of women in London who flirt with their own husbands is
      perfectly scandalous.  It looks so bad.  It is simply
      washing one’s clean linen in public.  Besides, now
      that I know you to be a confirmed Bunburyist I naturally want to
      talk to you about Bunburying.  I want to tell you the
      rules.
    %p
      %b> Jack.
      \  I’m not a Bunburyist at all.  If
      Gwendolen accepts me, I am going to kill my brother, indeed I
      think I’ll kill him in any case.  Cecily is a little
      too much interested in him.  It is rather a bore.  So I
      am going to get rid of #{ernest}.  And I strongly advise you to
      do the same with Mr. . . . with your invalid friend who has the
      absurd name.
    %p
      %b> Algernon.
      \  Nothing will induce me to part with
      Bunbury, and if you ever get married, which seems to me extremely
      problematic, you will be very glad to know Bunbury.  A man
      who marries without knowing Bunbury has a very tedious time of
      it.
    %p
      %b> Jack.
      \  That is nonsense.  If I marry a
      charming girl like Gwendolen, and she is the only girl I ever saw
      in my life that I would marry, I certainly won’t want to
      know Bunbury.
    %p
      %b> Algernon.
      \  Then your wife will.  You
      don’t seem to realise, that in married life three is
      company and two is none.
    %p
      %b> Jack.
      \  [Sententiously.]  That, my dear young
      friend, is the theory that the corrupt French Drama has been
      propounding for the last fifty years.
    %p
      %b> Algernon.
      \  Yes; and that the happy English home
      has proved in half the time.
    %p
      %b> Jack.
      \  For heaven’s sake, don’t try to
      be cynical.  It’s perfectly easy to be cynical.
    %p
      %b> Algernon.
      \  My dear fellow, it isn’t easy to
      be anything nowadays.  There’s such a lot of beastly
      competition about.  [The sound of an electric bell is
      heard.]  Ah! that must be Aunt Augusta.  Only
      relatives, or creditors, ever ring in that Wagnerian
      manner.  Now, if I get her out of the way for ten minutes,
      so that you can have an opportunity for proposing to Gwendolen,
      may I dine with you to-night at Willis’s?
    %p
      %b> Jack.
      \  I suppose so, if you want to.
    %p
      %b> Algernon.
      \  Yes, but you must be serious about
      it.  I hate people who are not serious about meals.  It
      is so shallow of them.

      Harbury.  I hadn’t been there since her poor
      husband’s death.  I never saw a woman so altered; she
      looks quite twenty years younger.  And now I’ll have a
      cup of tea, and one of those nice cucumber sandwiches you
      promised me.
    %p

      \  Certainly, Aunt Augusta.  [Goes

      comfortable where I am.
    %p
      %b> Algernon.
      \  [Picking up empty plate in

      cucumber sandwiches?  I ordered them specially.
    %p
      %b> Lane.
      \  [Gravely.]  There were no cucumbers in
      the market this morning, sir.  I went down twice.
    %p
      %b> Algernon.
      \  No cucumbers!
    %p
      %b> Lane.
      \  No, sir.  Not even for ready
      money.
    %p
      %b> Algernon.
      \  That will do, Lane, thank you.
    %p
      %b> Lane.
      \  Thank you, sir.  [Goes out.]
    %p
      %b> Algernon.
      \  I am greatly distressed, Aunt Augusta,
      about there being no cucumbers, not even for ready money.
    %p
      %b> Lady Bracknell.
      \  It really makes no matter,
      Algernon.  I had some crumpets with Lady Harbury, who seems
      to me to be living entirely for pleasure now.
    %p
      %b> Algernon.
      \  I hear her hair has turned quite gold
      from grief.
    %p
      %b> Lady Bracknell.
      \  It certainly has changed its
      colour.  From what cause I, of course, cannot say. 
      [
      %b Algernon
      crosses and hands tea.]  Thank you. 
      I’ve quite a treat for you to-night, Algernon.  I am
      going to send you down with Mary Farquhar.  She is such a
      nice woman, and so attentive to her husband.  It’s
      delightful to watch them.
    %p
      %b> Algernon.
      \  I am afraid, Aunt Augusta, I shall have
      to give up the pleasure of dining with you to-night after
      all.
    %p
      %b> Lady Bracknell.
      \  [Frowning.]  I hope not,
      Algernon.  It would put my table completely out.  Your
      uncle would have to dine upstairs.  Fortunately he is
      accustomed to that.
    %p
      %b> Algernon.
      \  It is a great bore, and, I need hardly
      say, a terrible disappointment to me, but the fact is I have just
      had a telegram to say that my poor friend Bunbury is very ill
      again.  [Exchanges glances with
      = succeed ".]\u{a0}" do
        %b Jack
    %p
      %b> Lady Bracknell.
      \  It is very strange.  This
      Mr. Bunbury seems to suffer from curiously bad health.
    %p
      %b> Algernon.
      \  Yes; poor Bunbury is a dreadful
      invalid.
    %p
      %b> Lady Bracknell.
      \  Well, I must say, Algernon, that
      I think it is high time that Mr. Bunbury made up his mind whether
      he was going to live or to die.  This shilly-shallying with
      the question is absurd.  Nor do I in any way approve of the
      modern sympathy with invalids.  I consider it morbid. 
      Illness of any kind is hardly a thing to be encouraged in
      others.  Health is the primary duty of life.  I am
      always telling that to your poor uncle, but he never seems to
      take much notice . . . as far as any improvement in his ailment
      goes.  I should be much obliged if you would ask Mr.
      Bunbury, from me, to be kind enough not to have a relapse on
      Saturday, for I rely on you to arrange my music for me.  It
      is my last reception, and one wants something that will encourage
      conversation, particularly at the end of the season when every
      one has practically said whatever they had to say, which, in most
      cases, was probably not much.
    %p
      %b> Algernon.
      \  I’ll speak to Bunbury, Aunt
      Augusta, if he is still conscious, and I think I can promise you
      he’ll be all right by Saturday.  Of course the music
      is a great difficulty.  You see, if one plays good music,
      people don’t listen, and if one plays bad music people
      don’t talk.  But I’ll run over the programme
      I’ve drawn out, if you will kindly come into the next room
      for a moment.
    %p
      %b> Lady Bracknell.
      \  Thank you, Algernon.  It is
      very thoughtful of you.  [Rising, and following

      \  Charming day it has been, Miss Fairfax.
    %p
      %b> Gwendolen.
      \  Pray don’t talk to me about the
      weather, Mr. Worthing.  Whenever people talk to me about the
      weather, I always feel quite certain that they mean something
      else.  And that makes me so nervous.
    %p
      %b> Jack.
      \  I do mean something else.
    %p
      %b> Gwendolen.
      \  I thought so.  In fact, I am
      never wrong.
    %p
      %b> Jack.
      \  And I would like to be allowed to take
      advantage of Lady Bracknell’s temporary absence . . .
    %p
      %b> Gwendolen.
      \  I would certainly advise you to do
      so.  Mamma has a way of coming back suddenly into a room
      that I have often had to speak to her about.
    %p
      %b> Jack.
      \  [Nervously.]  Miss Fairfax, ever since
      I met you I have admired you more than any girl . . . I have ever
      met since . . . I met you.
    %p
      %b> Gwendolen.
      \  Yes, I am quite well aware of the
      fact.  And I often wish that in public, at any rate, you had
      been more demonstrative.  For me you have always had an
      irresistible fascination.  Even before I met you I was far
      from indifferent to you.  [
      %b Jack
      looks at her in
      amazement.]  We live, as I hope you know, Mr. Worthing, in
      an age of ideals.  The fact is constantly mentioned in the
      more expensive monthly magazines, and has reached the provincial
      pulpits, I am told; and my ideal has always been to love some one
      of the name of #{ernest}.  There is something in that name that
      inspires absolute confidence.  The moment Algernon first
      mentioned to me that he had a friend called #{ernest}, I knew I was
      destined to love you.
    %p
      %b> Jack.
      \  You really love me, Gwendolen?
    %p
      %b> Gwendolen.
      \  Passionately!
    %p
      %b> Jack.
      \  Darling!  You don’t know how
      happy you’ve made me.
    %p
      %b> Gwendolen.
      \  My own #{ernest}!
    %p
      %b> Jack.
      \  But you don’t really mean to say that
      you couldn’t love me if my name wasn’t #{ernest}?
    %p
      %b> Gwendolen.
      \  But your name is #{ernest}.
    %p
      %b> Jack.
      \  Yes, I know it is.  But supposing it
      was something else?  Do you mean to say you couldn’t
      love me then?
    %p
      %b> Gwendolen.
      \  [Glibly.]  Ah! that is clearly a
      metaphysical speculation, and like most metaphysical speculations
      has very little reference at all to the actual facts of real
      life, as we know them.
    %p
      %b> Jack.
      \  Personally, darling, to speak quite
      candidly, I don’t much care about the name of #{ernest} . . .
      I don’t think the name suits me at all.
    %p
      %b> Gwendolen.
      \  It suits you perfectly.  It is a
      divine name.  It has a music of its own.  It produces
      vibrations.
    %p
      %b> Jack.
      \  Well, really, Gwendolen, I must say that I
      think there are lots of other much nicer names.  I think
      Jack, for instance, a charming name.
    %p
      %b> Gwendolen.
      \  Jack? . . . No, there is very little
      music in the name Jack, if any at all, indeed.  It does not
      thrill.  It produces absolutely no vibrations . . . I have
      known several Jacks, and they all, without exception, were more
      than usually plain.  Besides, Jack is a notorious
      domesticity for John!  And I pity any woman who is married
      to a man called John.  She would probably never be allowed
      to know the entrancing pleasure of a single moment’s
      solitude.  The only really safe name is #{ernest}.
    %p
      %b> Jack.
      \  Gwendolen, I must get christened at
      once—I mean we must get married at once.  There is no
      time to be lost.
    %p
      %b> Gwendolen.
      \  Married, Mr. Worthing?
    %p
      %b> Jack.
      \  [Astounded.]  Well . . . surely. 
      You know that I love you, and you led me to believe, Miss
      Fairfax, that you were not absolutely indifferent to me.
    %p
      %b> Gwendolen.
      \  I adore you.  But you
      haven’t proposed to me yet.  Nothing has been said at
      all about marriage.  The subject has not even been touched
      on.
    %p
      %b> Jack.
      \  Well . . . may I propose to you now?
    %p
      %b> Gwendolen.
      \  I think it would be an admirable
      opportunity.  And to spare you any possible disappointment,
      Mr. Worthing, I think it only fair to tell you quite frankly
      before-hand that I am fully determined to accept you.
    %p
      %b> Jack.
      \  Gwendolen!
    %p

      \  You know what I have got to say to you.
    %p
      %b> Gwendolen.
      \  Yes, but you don’t say it.

      on his knees.]
    %p
      %b> Gwendolen.
      \  Of course I will, darling.  How
      long you have been about it!  I am afraid you have had very
      little experience in how to propose.
    %p
      %b> Jack.
      \  My own one, I have never loved any one in
      the world but you.
    %p
      %b> Gwendolen.
      \  Yes, but men often propose for
      practice.  I know my brother Gerald does.  All my
      girl-friends tell me so.  What wonderfully blue eyes you
      have, #{ernest}!  They are quite, quite, blue.  I hope you
      will always look at me just like that, especially when there are
      other people present.  [Enter

      any one.  When you do become engaged to some one, I, or your
      father, should his health permit him, will inform you of the
      fact.  An engagement should come on a young girl as a
      surprise, pleasant or unpleasant, as the case may be.  It is
      hardly a matter that she could be allowed to arrange for herself
      \. . . And now I have a few questions to put to you, Mr.

      list of eligible young men, although I have the same list as the
      dear Duchess of Bolton has.  We work together, in
      fact.  However, I am quite ready to enter your name, should
      your answers be what a really affectionate mother requires. 
      Do you smoke?

      \  Well, yes, I must admit I smoke.
    %p
      %b> Lady Bracknell.
      \  I am glad to hear it.  A man
      should always have an occupation of some kind.  There are

      \  Twenty-nine.
    %p
      %b> Lady Bracknell.
      \  A very good age to be married
      at.  I have always been of opinion that a man who desires to
      get married should know either everything or nothing.  Which
      do you know?
    %p

      \  [After some hesitation.]  I know
      nothing, Lady Bracknell.
    %p
      %b> Lady Bracknell.
      \  I am pleased to hear it.  I
      do not approve of anything that tampers with natural
      ignorance.  Ignorance is like a delicate exotic fruit; touch
      it and the bloom is gone.  The whole theory of modern
      education is radically unsound.  Fortunately in England, at
      any rate, education produces no effect whatsoever.  If it
      did, it would prove a serious danger to the upper classes, and
      probably lead to acts of violence in Grosvenor Square.  What
      is your income?
    %p

      In land, or in investments?
    %p
      %b> Jack.
      \  In investments, chiefly.
    %p
      %b> Lady Bracknell.
      \  That is satisfactory.  What
      between the duties expected of one during one’s lifetime,
      and the duties exacted from one after one’s death, land has
      ceased to be either a profit or a pleasure.  It gives one
      position, and prevents one from keeping it up.  That’s
      all that can be said about land.
    %p
      %b> Jack.
      \  I have a country house with some land, of
      course, attached to it, about fifteen hundred acres, I believe;
      but I don’t depend on that for my real income.  In
      fact, as far as I can make out, the poachers are the only people
      who make anything out of it.
    %p
      %b> Lady Bracknell.
      \  A country house!  How many
      bedrooms?  Well, that point can be cleared up
      afterwards.  You have a town house, I hope?  A girl
      with a simple, unspoiled nature, like Gwendolen, could hardly be
      expected to reside in the country.
    %p
      %b> Jack.
      \  Well, I own a house in Belgrave Square, but
      it is let by the year to Lady Bloxham.  Of course, I can get
      it back whenever I like, at six months’ notice.
    %p
      %b> Lady Bracknell.
      \  Lady Bloxham?  I don’t
      know her.
    %p
      %b> Jack.
      \  Oh, she goes about very little.  She
      is a lady considerably advanced in years.
    %p
      %b> Lady Bracknell.
      \  Ah, nowadays that is no guarantee
      of respectability of character.  What number in Belgrave
      Square?
    %p
      %b> Jack.
      \  149.
    %p
      %b> Lady Bracknell.
      \  [Shaking her head.]  The
      unfashionable side.  I thought there was something. 
      However, that could easily be altered.
    %p
      %b> Jack.
      \  Do you mean the fashion, or the side?
    %p
      %b> Lady Bracknell.
      \  [Sternly.]  Both, if
      necessary, I presume.  What are your politics?
    %p
      %b> Jack.
      \  Well, I am afraid I really have none. 
      I am a Liberal Unionist.
    %p
      %b> Lady Bracknell.
      \  Oh, they count as Tories. 
      They dine with us.  Or come in the evening, at any
      rate.  Now to minor matters.  Are your parents
      living?
    %p
      %b> Jack.
      \  I have lost both my parents.
    %p
      %b> Lady Bracknell.
      \  To lose one parent, Mr. Worthing,
      may be regarded as a misfortune; to lose both looks like
      carelessness.  Who was your father?  He was evidently a
      man of some wealth.  Was he born in what the Radical papers
      call the purple of commerce, or did he rise from the ranks of the
      aristocracy?
    %p
      %b> Jack.
      \  I am afraid I really don’t
      know.  The fact is, Lady Bracknell, I said I had lost my
      parents.  It would be nearer the truth to say that my
      parents seem to have lost me . . . I don’t actually know
      who I am by birth.  I was . . . well, I was found.
    %p
      %b> Lady Bracknell.
      \  Found!
    %p
      %b> Jack.
      \  The late Mr. Thomas Cardew, an old
      gentleman of a very charitable and kindly disposition, found me,
      and gave me the name of Worthing, because he happened to have a
      first-class ticket for Worthing in his pocket at the time. 
      Worthing is a place in Sussex.  It is a seaside resort.
    %p
      %b> Lady Bracknell.
      \  Where did the charitable
      gentleman who had a first-class ticket for this seaside resort
      find you?
    %p
      %b> Jack.
      \  [Gravely.]  In a hand-bag.
    %p
      %b> Lady Bracknell.
      \  A hand-bag?
    %p
      %b> Jack.
      \  [Very seriously.]  Yes, Lady
      Bracknell.  I was in a hand-bag—a somewhat large,
      black leather hand-bag, with handles to it—an ordinary
      hand-bag in fact.
    %p
      %b> Lady Bracknell.
      \  In what locality did this Mr.
      James, or Thomas, Cardew come across this ordinary hand-bag?
    %p
      %b> Jack.
      \  In the cloak-room at Victoria
      Station.  It was given to him in mistake for his own.
    %p
      %b> Lady Bracknell.
      \  The cloak-room at Victoria
      Station?
    %p
      %b> Jack.
      \  Yes.  The Brighton line.
    %p
      %b> Lady Bracknell.
      \  The line is immaterial.  Mr.
      Worthing, I confess I feel somewhat bewildered by what you have
      just told me.  To be born, or at any rate bred, in a
      hand-bag, whether it had handles or not, seems to me to display a
      contempt for the ordinary decencies of family life that reminds
      one of the worst excesses of the French Revolution.  And I
      presume you know what that unfortunate movement led to?  As
      for the particular locality in which the hand-bag was found, a
      cloak-room at a railway station might serve to conceal a social
      indiscretion—has probably, indeed, been used for that
      purpose before now—but it could hardly be regarded as an
      assured basis for a recognised position in good society.
    %p
      %b> Jack.
      \  May I ask you then what you would advise me
      to do?  I need hardly say I would do anything in the world
      to ensure Gwendolen’s happiness.
    %p
      %b> Lady Bracknell.
      \  I would strongly advise you, Mr.
      Worthing, to try and acquire some relations as soon as possible,
      and to make a definite effort to produce at any rate one parent,
      of either sex, before the season is quite over.
    %p
      %b> Jack.
      \  Well, I don’t see how I could
      possibly manage to do that.  I can produce the hand-bag at
      any moment.  It is in my dressing-room at home.  I
      really think that should satisfy you, Lady Bracknell.
    %p
      %b> Lady Bracknell.
      \  Me, sir!  What has it to do
      with me?  You can hardly imagine that I and Lord Bracknell
      would dream of allowing our only daughter—a girl brought up
      with the utmost care—to marry into a cloak-room, and form
      an alliance with a parcel?  Good morning, Mr. Worthing!
    %p
      [
      %b Lady Bracknell
      sweeps out in majestic
      indignation.]
    %p
      %b> Jack.
      \  Good morning!  [
      %b> Algernon
      , from
      the other room, strikes up the Wedding March.  Jack looks
      perfectly furious, and goes to the door.]  For
      goodness’ sake don’t play that ghastly tune,
      Algy.  How idiotic you are!
    %p
      [The music stops and
      %b Algernon
      enters cheerily.]
    %p
      %b> Algernon.
      \  Didn’t it go off all right, old
      boy?  You don’t mean to say Gwendolen refused
      you?  I know it is a way she has.  She is always
      refusing people.  I think it is most ill-natured of her.
    %p
      %b> Jack.
      \  Oh, Gwendolen is as right as a
      trivet.  As far as she is concerned, we are engaged. 
      Her mother is perfectly unbearable.  Never met such a Gorgon
      \. . . I don’t really know what a Gorgon is like, but I am
      quite sure that Lady Bracknell is one.  In any case, she is
      a monster, without being a myth, which is rather unfair . . . I
      beg your pardon, Algy, I suppose I shouldn’t talk about
      your own aunt in that way before you.
    %p
      %b> Algernon.
      \  My dear boy, I love hearing my
      relations abused.  It is the only thing that makes me put up
      with them at all.  Relations are simply a tedious pack of
      people, who haven’t got the remotest knowledge of how to
      live, nor the smallest instinct about when to die.
    %p
      %b> Jack.
      \  Oh, that is nonsense!
    %p
      %b> Algernon.
      \  It isn’t!
    %p
      %b> Jack.
      \  Well, I won’t argue about the
      matter.  You always want to argue about things.
    %p
      %b> Algernon.
      \  That is exactly what things were
      originally made for.
    %p
      %b> Jack.
      \  Upon my word, if I thought that, I’d
      shoot myself . . . [A pause.]  You don’t think there
      is any chance of Gwendolen becoming like her mother in about a
      hundred and fifty years, do you, Algy?
    %p
      %b> Algernon.
      \  All women become like their
      mothers.  That is their tragedy.  No man does. 
      That’s his.
    %p
      %b> Jack.
      \  Is that clever?
    %p
      %b> Algernon.
      \  It is perfectly phrased! and quite as
      true as any observation in civilised life should be.
    %p
      %b> Jack.
      \  I am sick to death of cleverness. 
      Everybody is clever nowadays.  You can’t go anywhere
      without meeting clever people.  The thing has become an
      absolute public nuisance.  I wish to goodness we had a few
      fools left.
    %p
      %b> Algernon.
      \  We have.
    %p
      %b> Jack.
      \  I should extremely like to meet them. 
      What do they talk about?
    %p
      %b> Algernon.
      \  The fools?  Oh! about the clever
      people, of course.
    %p
      %b> Jack.
      \  What fools!
    %p
      %b> Algernon.
      \  By the way, did you tell Gwendolen the
      truth about your being #{ernest} in town, and Jack in the
      country?
    %p
      %b> Jack.
      \  [In a very patronising manner.]  My
      dear fellow, the truth isn’t quite the sort of thing one
      tells to a nice, sweet, refined girl.  What extraordinary
      ideas you have about the way to behave to a woman!
    %p
      %b> Algernon.
      \  The only way to behave to a woman is to
      make love to her, if she is pretty, and to some one else, if she
      is plain.
    %p
      %b> Jack.
      \  Oh, that is nonsense.
    %p
      %b> Algernon.
      \  What about your brother?  What
      about the profligate #{ernest}?
    %p
      %b> Jack.
      \  Oh, before the end of the week I shall have
      got rid of him.  I’ll say he died in Paris of
      apoplexy.  Lots of people die of apoplexy, quite suddenly,
      don’t they?
    %p
      %b> Algernon.
      \  Yes, but it’s hereditary, my dear
      fellow.  It’s a sort of thing that runs in
      families.  You had much better say a severe chill.
    %p
      %b> Jack.
      \  You are sure a severe chill isn’t
      hereditary, or anything of that kind?
    %p
      %b> Algernon.
      \  Of course it isn’t!
    %p
      %b> Jack.
      \  Very well, then.  My poor brother
      #{ernest} to carried off suddenly, in Paris, by a severe
      chill.  That gets rid of him.
    %p
      %b> Algernon.
      \  But I thought you said that . . . Miss
      Cardew was a little too much interested in your poor brother
      #{ernest}?  Won’t she feel his loss a good deal?
    %p
      %b> Jack.
      \  Oh, that is all right.  Cecily is not
      a silly romantic girl, I am glad to say.  She has got a
      capital appetite, goes long walks, and pays no attention at all
      to her lessons.
    %p
      %b> Algernon.
      \  I would rather like to see Cecily.
    %p
      %b> Jack.
      \  I will take very good care you never
      do.  She is excessively pretty, and she is only just
      eighteen.
    %p
      %b> Algernon.
      \  Have you told Gwendolen yet that you
      have an excessively pretty ward who is only just eighteen?
    %p
      %b> Jack.
      \  Oh! one doesn’t blurt these things
      out to people.  Cecily and Gwendolen are perfectly certain
      to be extremely great friends.  I’ll bet you anything
      you like that half an hour after they have met, they will be
      calling each other sister.
    %p
      %b> Algernon.
      \  Women only do that when they have
      called each other a lot of other things first.  Now, my dear
      boy, if we want to get a good table at Willis’s, we really
      must go and dress.  Do you know it is nearly seven?
    %p
      %b> Jack.
      \  [Irritably.]  Oh!  It always is
      nearly seven.
    %p
      %b> Algernon.
      \  Well, I’m hungry.

      to a theatre?

      \  Oh no!  I loathe listening.
    %p
      %b> Algernon.
      \  Well, let us go to the Club?
    %p
      %b> Jack.
      \  Oh, no!  I hate talking.
    %p
      %b> Algernon.
      \  Well, we might trot round to the Empire
      at ten?
    %p
      %b> Jack.
      \  Oh, no!  I can’t bear looking at
      things.  It is so silly.
    %p
      %b> Algernon.
      \  Well, what shall we do?
    %p
      %b> Jack.
      \  Nothing!
    %p
      %b> Algernon.
      \  It is awfully hard work doing
      nothing.  However, I don’t mind hard work where there

      I can allow this at all.

      \  #{ernest}, we may never be married. 
      From the expression on mamma’s face I fear we never
      shall.  Few parents nowadays pay any regard to what their
      children say to them.  The old-fashioned respect for the
      young is fast dying out.  Whatever influence I ever had over
      mamma, I lost at the age of three.  But although she may
      prevent us from becoming man and wife, and I may marry some one
      else, and marry often, nothing that she can possibly do can alter
      my eternal devotion to you.

      %b> Gwendolen.
      \  The story of your romantic origin, as
      related to me by mamma, with unpleasing comments, has naturally
      stirred the deeper fibres of my nature.  Your Christian name
      has an irresistible fascination.  The simplicity of your
      character makes you exquisitely incomprehensible to me. 
      Your town address at the Albany I have.  What is your
      address in the country?

      \  There is a good postal service, I

      desperate.  That of course will require serious

      a table covered with books, are set under a large yew-tree.

      discovered seated at the table. 
      %b Cecily
      is at the back watering flowers.]
    %p
      %b> Miss Prism.
      \  [Calling.]  Cecily,
      Cecily!  Surely such a utilitarian occupation as the
      watering of flowers is rather Moulton’s duty than
      yours?  Especially at a moment when intellectual pleasures
      await you.  Your German grammar is on the table.  Pray
      open it at page fifteen.  We will repeat yesterday’s
      lesson.
    %p
      %b> Cecily.
      \  [Coming over very slowly.]  But I
      don’t like German.  It isn’t at all a becoming
      language.  I know perfectly well that I look quite plain
      after my German lesson.
    %p
      %b> Miss Prism.
      \  Child, you know how anxious your
      guardian is that you should improve yourself in every way. 
      He laid particular stress on your German, as he was leaving for
      town yesterday.  Indeed, he always lays stress on your
      German when he is leaving for town.
    %p
      %b> Cecily.
      \  Dear Uncle Jack is so very serious! 
      Sometimes he is so serious that I think he cannot be quite
      well.
    %p
      %b> Miss Prism.
      \  [Drawing herself up.]  Your
      guardian enjoys the best of health, and his gravity of demeanour
      is especially to be commended in one so comparatively young as he
      is.  I know no one who has a higher sense of duty and
      responsibility.
    %p
      %b> Cecily.
      \  I suppose that is why he often looks a
      little bored when we three are together.
    %p
      %b> Miss Prism.
      \  Cecily!  I am surprised at
      you.  Mr. Worthing has many troubles in his life.  Idle
      merriment and triviality would be out of place in his
      conversation.  You must remember his constant anxiety about
      that unfortunate young man his brother.
    %p
      %b> Cecily.
      \  I wish Uncle Jack would allow that
      unfortunate young man, his brother, to come down here
      sometimes.  We might have a good influence over him, Miss
      Prism.  I am sure you certainly would.  You know
      German, and geology, and things of that kind influence a man very
      much.  [
      %b Cecily
      begins to write in her diary.]
    %p
      %b> Miss Prism.
      \  [Shaking her head.]  I do not
      think that even I could produce any effect on a character that
      according to his own brother’s admission is irretrievably
      weak and vacillating.  Indeed I am not sure that I would
      desire to reclaim him.  I am not in favour of this modern
      mania for turning bad people into good people at a moment’s
      notice.  As a man sows so let him reap.  You must put
      away your diary, Cecily.  I really don’t see why you
      should keep a diary at all.
    %p
      %b> Cecily.
      \  I keep a diary in order to enter the
      wonderful secrets of my life.  If I didn’t write them
      down, I should probably forget all about them.
    %p
      %b> Miss Prism.
      \  Memory, my dear Cecily, is the diary
      that we all carry about with us.
    %p
      %b> Cecily.
      \  Yes, but it usually chronicles the things
      that have never happened, and couldn’t possibly have
      happened.  I believe that Memory is responsible for nearly
      all the three-volume novels that Mudie sends us.
    %p
      %b> Miss Prism.
      \  Do not speak slightingly of the
      three-volume novel, Cecily.  I wrote one myself in earlier
      days.
    %p
      %b> Cecily.
      \  Did you really, Miss Prism?  How
      wonderfully clever you are!  I hope it did not end
      happily?  I don’t like novels that end happily. 
      They depress me so much.
    %p
      %b> Miss Prism.
      \  The good ended happily, and the bad
      unhappily.  That is what Fiction means.
    %p
      %b> Cecily.
      \  I suppose so.  But it seems very
      unfair.  And was your novel ever published?
    %p
      %b> Miss Prism.
      \  Alas! no.  The manuscript
      unfortunately was abandoned.  [
      %b Cecily
      starts.] 
      I use the word in the sense of lost or mislaid.  To your
      work, child, these speculations are profitless.
    %p
      %b> Cecily.
      \  [Smiling.]  But I see dear Dr.
      Chasuble coming up through the garden.
    %p
      %b> Miss Prism.
      \  [Rising and advancing.]  Dr.
      Chasuble!  This is indeed a pleasure.
    %p
      [Enter
      = succeed ".]" do
        %b Canon Chasuble
    %p
      %b> Chasuble.
      \  And how are we this morning?  Miss
      Prism, you are, I trust, well?
    %p
      %b> Cecily.
      \  Miss Prism has just been complaining of a
      slight headache.  I think it would do her so much good to
      have a short stroll with you in the Park, Dr. Chasuble.
    %p
      %b> Miss Prism.
      \  Cecily, I have not mentioned anything
      about a headache.
    %p
      %b> Cecily.
      \  No, dear Miss Prism, I know that, but I
      felt instinctively that you had a headache.  Indeed I was
      thinking about that, and not about my German lesson, when the
      Rector came in.
    %p
      %b> Chasuble.
      \  I hope, Cecily, you are not
      inattentive.
    %p
      %b> Cecily.
      \  Oh, I am afraid I am.
    %p
      %b> Chasuble.
      \  That is strange.  Were I fortunate
      enough to be Miss Prism’s pupil, I would hang upon her
      lips.  [
      %b Miss Prism
      glares.]  I spoke
      metaphorically.—My metaphor was drawn from bees. 
      Ahem!  Mr. Worthing, I suppose, has not returned from town
      yet?
    %p
      %b> Miss Prism.
      \  We do not expect him till Monday
      afternoon.
    %p
      %b> Chasuble.
      \  Ah yes, he usually likes to spend his
      Sunday in London.  He is not one of those whose sole aim is
      enjoyment, as, by all accounts, that unfortunate young man his
      brother seems to be.  But I must not disturb Egeria and her
      pupil any longer.
    %p
      %b> Miss Prism.
      \  Egeria?  My name is
      Lætitia, Doctor.
    %p
      %b> Chasuble.
      \  [Bowing.]  A classical allusion
      merely, drawn from the Pagan authors.  I shall see you both
      no doubt at Evensong?
    %p
      %b> Miss Prism.
      \  I think, dear Doctor, I will have a
      stroll with you.  I find I have a headache after all, and a
      walk might do it good.
    %p
      %b> Chasuble.
      \  With pleasure, Miss Prism, with
      pleasure.  We might go as far as the schools and back.
    %p
      %b> Miss Prism.
      \  That would be delightful. 
      Cecily, you will read your Political Economy in my absence. 
      The chapter on the Fall of the Rupee you may omit.  It is
      somewhat too sensational.  Even these metallic problems have
      their melodramatic side.
    %p
      [Goes down the garden with
      = succeed ".]" do
        %b Dr. Chasuble
    %p
      %b> Cecily.
      \  [Picks up books and throws them back on
      table.]  Horrid Political Economy!  Horrid
      Geography!  Horrid, horrid German!
    %p
      [Enter
      %b Merriman
      with a card on a salver.]
    %p
      %b> Merriman
      \.  Mr. #{ernest} Worthing has just driven
      over from the station.  He has brought his luggage with
      him.
    %p
      %b> Cecily.
      \  [Takes the card and reads it.] 
      \‘Mr. #{ernest} Worthing, B. 4, The Albany, W.’ 
      Uncle Jack’s brother!  Did you tell him Mr. Worthing
      was in town?
    %p
      %b> Merriman
      \.  Yes, Miss.  He seemed very much
      disappointed.  I mentioned that you and Miss Prism were in
      the garden.  He said he was anxious to speak to you
      privately for a moment.
    %p
      %b> Cecily.
      \  Ask Mr. #{ernest} Worthing to come
      here.  I suppose you had better talk to the housekeeper
      about a room for him.
    %p
      %b> Merriman
      \.  Yes, Miss.
    %p
      [
      %b Merriman
      goes off.]
    %p
      %b> Cecily.
      \  I have never met any really wicked person
      before.  I feel rather frightened.  I am so afraid he
      will look just like every one else.
    %p
      [Enter

      \  [Raising his hat.]  You are my
      little cousin Cecily, I’m sure.
    %p
      %b> Cecily.
      \  You are under some strange mistake. 
      I am not little.  In fact, I believe I am more than usually
      tall for my age.  [
      %b Algernon
      is rather taken
      aback.]  But I am your cousin Cecily.  You, I see from
      your card, are Uncle Jack’s brother, my cousin #{ernest}, my
      wicked cousin #{ernest}.
    %p
      %b> Algernon.
      \  Oh! I am not really wicked at all,
      cousin Cecily.  You mustn’t think that I am
      wicked.
    %p
      %b> Cecily.
      \  If you are not, then you have certainly
      been deceiving us all in a very inexcusable manner.  I hope
      you have not been leading a double life, pretending to be wicked
      and being really good all the time.  That would be
      hypocrisy.
    %p
      %b> Algernon.
      \  [Looks at her in amazement.] 
      Oh!  Of course I have been rather reckless.
    %p
      %b> Cecily.
      \  I am glad to hear it.
    %p
      %b> Algernon.
      \  In fact, now you mention the subject, I
      have been very bad in my own small way.
    %p
      %b> Cecily.
      \  I don’t think you should be so
      proud of that, though I am sure it must have been very
      pleasant.
    %p
      %b> Algernon.
      \  It is much pleasanter being here with
      you.
    %p
      %b> Cecily.
      \  I can’t understand how you are here
      at all.  Uncle Jack won’t be back till Monday
      afternoon.
    %p
      %b> Algernon.
      \  That is a great disappointment.  I
      am obliged to go up by the first train on Monday morning.  I
      have a business appointment that I am anxious . . . to miss?
    %p
      %b> Cecily.
      \  Couldn’t you miss it anywhere but
      in London?
    %p
      %b> Algernon.
      \  No: the appointment is in London.
    %p
      %b> Cecily.
      \  Well, I know, of course, how important it
      is not to keep a business engagement, if one wants to retain any
      sense of the beauty of life, but still I think you had better
      wait till Uncle Jack arrives.  I know he wants to speak to
      you about your emigrating.
    %p
      %b> Algernon.
      \  About my what?
    %p
      %b> Cecily.
      \  Your emigrating.  He has gone up to
      buy your outfit.
    %p
      %b> Algernon.
      \  I certainly wouldn’t let Jack buy
      my outfit.  He has no taste in neckties at all.
    %p
      %b> Cecily.
      \  I don’t think you will require
      neckties.  Uncle Jack is sending you to Australia.
    %p
      %b> Algernon.
      \  Australia!  I’d sooner
      die.
    %p
      %b> Cecily.
      \  Well, he said at dinner on Wednesday
      night, that you would have to choose between this world, the next
      world, and Australia.
    %p
      %b> Algernon.
      \  Oh, well!  The accounts I have
      received of Australia and the next world, are not particularly
      encouraging.  This world is good enough for me, cousin
      Cecily.
    %p
      %b> Cecily.
      \  Yes, but are you good enough for it?
    %p
      %b> Algernon.
      \  I’m afraid I’m not
      that.  That is why I want you to reform me.  You might
      make that your mission, if you don’t mind, cousin
      Cecily.
    %p
      %b> Cecily.
      \  I’m afraid I’ve no time, this
      afternoon.
    %p
      %b> Algernon.
      \  Well, would you mind my reforming
      myself this afternoon?
    %p
      %b> Cecily.
      \  It is rather Quixotic of you.  But I
      think you should try.
    %p
      %b> Algernon.
      \  I will.  I feel better
      already.
    %p
      %b> Cecily.
      \  You are looking a little worse.
    %p
      %b> Algernon.
      \  That is because I am hungry.
    %p
      %b> Cecily.
      \  How thoughtless of me.  I should
      have remembered that when one is going to lead an entirely new
      life, one requires regular and wholesome meals.  Won’t
      you come in?
    %p
      %b> Algernon.
      \  Thank you.  Might I have a
      buttonhole first?  I never have any appetite unless I have a
      buttonhole first.
    %p
      %b> Cecily.
      \  A Marechal Niel?  [Picks up
      scissors.]
    %p
      %b> Algernon.
      \  No, I’d sooner have a pink
      rose.
    %p
      %b> Cecily.
      \  Why?  [Cuts a flower.]
    %p
      %b> Algernon.
      \  Because you are like a pink rose,
      Cousin Cecily.
    %p
      %b> Cecily.
      \  I don’t think it can be right for
      you to talk to me like that.  Miss Prism never says such
      things to me.
    %p
      %b> Algernon.
      \  Then Miss Prism is a short-sighted old
      lady.  [
      %b Cecily
      puts the rose in his
      buttonhole.]  You are the prettiest girl I ever saw.
    %p
      %b> Cecily.
      \  Miss Prism says that all good looks are a
      snare.
    %p
      %b> Algernon.
      \  They are a snare that every sensible
      man would like to be caught in.
    %p
      %b> Cecily.
      \  Oh, I don’t think I would care to
      catch a sensible man.  I shouldn’t know what to talk
      to him about.
    %p
      [They pass into the house. 
      %b Miss Prism
      and
      %b
        Dr.
        Chasuble
      return.]
    %p
      %b> Miss Prism.
      \  You are too much alone, dear Dr.
      Chasuble.  You should get married.  A misanthrope I can
      understand—a womanthrope, never!
    %p
      %b> Chasuble.
      \  [With a scholar’s shudder.] 
      Believe me, I do not deserve so neologistic a phrase.  The
      precept as well as the practice of the Primitive Church was
      distinctly against matrimony.
    %p
      %b> Miss Prism.
      \  [Sententiously.]  That is
      obviously the reason why the Primitive Church has not lasted up
      to the present day.  And you do not seem to realise, dear
      Doctor, that by persistently remaining single, a man converts
      himself into a permanent public temptation.  Men should be
      more careful; this very celibacy leads weaker vessels astray.
    %p
      %b> Chasuble.
      \  But is a man not equally attractive
      when married?
    %p
      %b> Miss Prism.
      \  No married man is ever attractive
      except to his wife.
    %p
      %b> Chasuble.
      \  And often, I’ve been told, not
      even to her.
    %p
      %b> Miss Prism.
      \  That depends on the intellectual
      sympathies of the woman.  Maturity can always be depended
      on.  Ripeness can be trusted.  Young women are
      green.  [
      %b Dr. Chasuble
      starts.]  I spoke
      horticulturally.  My metaphor was drawn from fruits. 
      But where is Cecily?
    %p
      %b> Chasuble.
      \  Perhaps she followed us to the
      schools.
    %p
      [Enter
      %b Jack
      slowly from the back of the garden. 
      He is dressed in the deepest mourning, with crape hatband and
      black gloves.]
    %p
      %b> Miss Prism.
      \  Mr. Worthing!
    %p
      %b> Chasuble.
      \  Mr. Worthing?
    %p
      %b> Miss Prism.
      \  This is indeed a surprise.  We
      did not look for you till Monday afternoon.
    %p
      %b> Jack.
      \  [Shakes
      %b Miss Prism’s
      hand in a
      tragic manner.]  I have returned sooner than I
      expected.  Dr. Chasuble, I hope you are well?
    %p
      %b> Chasuble.
      \  Dear Mr. Worthing, I trust this garb of
      woe does not betoken some terrible calamity?
    %p
      %b> Jack.
      \  My brother.
    %p
      %b> Miss Prism.
      \  More shameful debts and
      extravagance?
    %p
      %b> Chasuble.
      \  Still leading his life of pleasure?
    %p
      %b> Jack.
      \  [Shaking his head.]  Dead!
    %p
      %b> Chasuble.
      \  Your brother #{ernest} dead?
    %p
      %b> Jack.
      \  Quite dead.
    %p
      %b> Miss Prism.
      \  What a lesson for him!  I trust
      he will profit by it.
    %p
      %b> Chasuble.
      \  Mr. Worthing, I offer you my sincere
      condolence.  You have at least the consolation of knowing
      that you were always the most generous and forgiving of
      brothers.
    %p
      %b> Jack.
      \  Poor #{ernest}!  He had many faults, but
      it is a sad, sad blow.
    %p
      %b> Chasuble.
      \  Very sad indeed.  Were you with
      him at the end?
    %p
      %b> Jack.
      \  No.  He died abroad; in Paris, in
      fact.  I had a telegram last night from the manager of the
      Grand Hotel.
    %p
      %b> Chasuble.
      \  Was the cause of death mentioned?
    %p
      %b> Jack.
      \  A severe chill, it seems.
    %p
      %b> Miss Prism.
      \  As a man sows, so shall he reap.
    %p
      %b> Chasuble.
      \  [Raising his hand.]  Charity, dear
      Miss Prism, charity!  None of us are perfect.  I myself
      am peculiarly susceptible to draughts.  Will the interment
      take place here?
    %p
      %b> Jack.
      \  No.  He seems to have expressed a
      desire to be buried in Paris.
    %p
      %b> Chasuble.
      \  In Paris!  [Shakes his
      head.]  I fear that hardly points to any very serious state
      of mind at the last.  You would no doubt wish me to make
      some slight allusion to this tragic domestic affliction next
      Sunday.  [
      %b Jack
      presses his hand convulsively.] 
      My sermon on the meaning of the manna in the wilderness can be
      adapted to almost any occasion, joyful, or, as in the present
      case, distressing.  [All sigh.]  I have preached it at
      harvest celebrations, christenings, confirmations, on days of
      humiliation and festal days.  The last time I delivered it
      was in the Cathedral, as a charity sermon on behalf of the
      Society for the Prevention of Discontent among the Upper
      Orders.  The Bishop, who was present, was much struck by
      some of the analogies I drew.
    %p
      %b> Jack.
      \  Ah! that reminds me, you mentioned
      christenings I think, Dr. Chasuble?  I suppose you know how
      to christen all right?  [
      %b Dr. Chasuble
      looks
      astounded.]  I mean, of course, you are continually
      christening, aren’t you?
    %p
      %b> Miss Prism.
      \  It is, I regret to say, one of the
      Rector’s most constant duties in this parish.  I have
      often spoken to the poorer classes on the subject.  But they
      don’t seem to know what thrift is.
    %p
      %b> Chasuble.
      \  But is there any particular infant in
      whom you are interested, Mr. Worthing?  Your brother was, I
      believe, unmarried, was he not?
    %p
      %b> Jack.
      \  Oh yes.
    %p
      %b> Miss Prism.
      \  [Bitterly.]  People who live
      entirely for pleasure usually are.
    %p
      %b> Jack.
      \  But it is not for any child, dear
      Doctor.  I am very fond of children.  No! the fact is,
      I would like to be christened myself, this afternoon, if you have
      nothing better to do.
    %p
      %b> Chasuble.
      \  But surely, Mr. Worthing, you have been
      christened already?
    %p
      %b> Jack.
      \  I don’t remember anything about
      it.
    %p
      %b> Chasuble.
      \  But have you any grave doubts on the
      subject?
    %p
      %b> Jack.
      \  I certainly intend to have.  Of course
      I don’t know if the thing would bother you in any way, or
      if you think I am a little too old now.
    %p
      %b> Chasuble.
      \  Not at all.  The sprinkling, and,
      indeed, the immersion of adults is a perfectly canonical
      practice.
    %p
      %b> Jack.
      \  Immersion!
    %p
      %b> Chasuble.
      \  You need have no apprehensions. 
      Sprinkling is all that is necessary, or indeed I think
      advisable.  Our weather is so changeable.  At what hour
      would you wish the ceremony performed?
    %p
      %b> Jack.
      \  Oh, I might trot round about five if that
      would suit you.
    %p
      %b> Chasuble.
      \  Perfectly, perfectly!  In fact I
      have two similar ceremonies to perform at that time.  A case
      of twins that occurred recently in one of the outlying cottages
      on your own estate.  Poor Jenkins the carter, a most
      hard-working man.
    %p
      %b> Jack.
      \  Oh!  I don’t see much fun in
      being christened along with other babies.  It would be
      childish.  Would half-past five do?
    %p
      %b> Chasuble.
      \  Admirably!  Admirably! 
      [Takes out watch.]  And now, dear Mr. Worthing, I will not
      intrude any longer into a house of sorrow.  I would merely
      beg you not to be too much bowed down by grief.  What seem
      to us bitter trials are often blessings in disguise.
    %p
      %b> Miss Prism.
      \  This seems to me a blessing of an
      extremely obvious kind.

      knows perfectly well why.
    %p

      \  Uncle Jack, do be nice.  There is
      some good in every one.  #{ernest} has just been telling me
      about his poor invalid friend Mr. Bunbury whom he goes to visit
      so often.  And surely there must be much good in one who is
      kind to an invalid, and leaves the pleasures of London to sit by
      a bed of pain.
    %p
      %b> Jack.
      \  Oh! he has been talking about Bunbury, has
      he?
    %p

      Bunbury, and his terrible state of health.

      \  Of course I admit that the faults were
      all on my side.  But I must say that I think that Brother
      John’s coldness to me is peculiarly painful.  I
      expected a more enthusiastic welcome, especially considering it
      is the first time I have come here.
    %p

      \  Uncle Jack, if you don’t shake

      that.  I don’t like it.
    %p
      %b> Algernon.
      \  Well, I don’t like your
      clothes.  You look perfectly ridiculous in them.  Why
      on earth don’t you go up and change?  It is perfectly
      childish to be in deep mourning for a man who is actually staying
      for a whole week with you in your house as a guest.  I call
      it grotesque.
    %p
      %b> Jack.
      \  You are certainly not staying with me for a
      whole week as a guest or anything else.  You have got to
      leave . . . by the four-five train.
    %p
      %b> Algernon.
      \  I certainly won’t leave you so
      long as you are in mourning.  It would be most
      unfriendly.  If I were in mourning you would stay with me, I
      suppose.  I should think it very unkind if you
      didn’t.
    %p
      %b> Jack.
      \  Well, will you go if I change my
      clothes?
    %p
      %b> Algernon.
      \  Yes, if you are not too long.  I
      never saw anybody take so long to dress, and with such little
      result.
    %p
      %b> Jack.
      \  Well, at any rate, that is better than
      being always over-dressed as you are.
    %p
      %b> Algernon.
      \  If I am occasionally a little
      over-dressed, I make up for it by being always immensely
      over-educated.
    %p
      %b> Jack.
      \  Your vanity is ridiculous, your conduct an
      outrage, and your presence in my garden utterly absurd. 
      However, you have got to catch the four-five, and I hope you will
      have a pleasant journey back to town.  This Bunburying, as
      you call it, has not been a great success for you.
    %p [Goes into the house.]
    %p
      %b> Algernon.
      \  I think it has been a great
      success.  I’m in love with Cecily, and that is

      \  I am afraid so.  It’s a very
      painful parting.
    %p
      %b> Cecily.
      \  It is always painful to part from people
      whom one has known for a very brief space of time.  The
      absence of old friends one can endure with equanimity.  But
      even a momentary separation from anyone to whom one has just been

      of her own thoughts and impressions, and consequently meant for
      publication.  When it appears in volume form I hope you will
      order a copy.  But pray, #{ernest}, don’t stop.  I

      \  You silly boy!  Of course. 
      Why, we have been engaged for the last three months.

      \  For the last three months?
    %p

      Thursday.
    %p
      %b> Algernon.
      \  But how did we become engaged?
    %p
      %b> Cecily.
      \  Well, ever since dear Uncle Jack first
      confessed to us that he had a younger brother who was very wicked
      and bad, you of course have formed the chief topic of
      conversation between myself and Miss Prism.  And of course a
      man who is much talked about is always very attractive.  One
      feels there must be something in him, after all.  I daresay
      it was foolish of me, but I fell in love with you, #{ernest}.
    %p
      %b> Algernon.
      \  Darling!  And when was the
      engagement actually settled?
    %p
      %b> Cecily.
      \  On the 14th of February last.  Worn
      out by your entire ignorance of my existence, I determined to end
      the matter one way or the other, and after a long struggle with
      myself I accepted you under this dear old tree here.  The
      next day I bought this little ring in your name, and this is the
      little bangle with the true lover’s knot I promised you
      always to wear.
    %p
      %b> Algernon.
      \  Did I give you this?  It’s
      very pretty, isn’t it?
    %p
      %b> Cecily.
      \  Yes, you’ve wonderfully good taste,
      #{ernest}.  It’s the excuse I’ve always given for
      your leading such a bad life.  And this is the box in which
      I keep all your dear letters.  [Kneels at table, opens box,
      and produces letters tied up with blue ribbon.]
    %p
      %b> Algernon.
      \  My letters!  But, my own sweet
      Cecily, I have never written you any letters.
    %p
      %b> Cecily.
      \  You need hardly remind me of that,
      #{ernest}.  I remember only too well that I was forced to write
      your letters for you.  I wrote always three times a week,
      and sometimes oftener.
    %p
      %b> Algernon.
      \  Oh, do let me read them, Cecily?
    %p
      %b> Cecily.
      \  Oh, I couldn’t possibly.  They
      would make you far too conceited.  [Replaces box.]  The
      three you wrote me after I had broken off the engagement are so
      beautiful, and so badly spelled, that even now I can hardly read
      them without crying a little.
    %p
      %b> Algernon.
      \  But was our engagement ever broken
      off?
    %p
      %b> Cecily.
      \  Of course it was.  On the 22nd of
      last March.  You can see the entry if you like. [Shows

      #{ernest}.  I feel it is better to do so.  The weather
      still continues charming.’
    %p
      %b> Algernon.
      \  But why on earth did you break it
      off?  What had I done?  I had done nothing at
      all.  Cecily, I am very much hurt indeed to hear you broke
      it off.  Particularly when the weather was so charming.
    %p
      %b> Cecily.
      \  It would hardly have been a really
      serious engagement if it hadn’t been broken off at least
      once.  But I forgave you before the week was out.
    %p
      %b> Algernon.
      \  [Crossing to her, and kneeling.] 
      What a perfect angel you are, Cecily.
    %p
      %b> Cecily.
      \  You dear romantic boy.  [He kisses
      her, she puts her fingers through his hair.]  I hope your
      hair curls naturally, does it?
    %p
      %b> Algernon.
      \  Yes, darling, with a little help from
      others.
    %p
      %b> Cecily.
      \  I am so glad.
    %p
      %b> Algernon.
      \  You’ll never break off our
      engagement again, Cecily?
    %p
      %b> Cecily.
      \  I don’t think I could break it off
      now that I have actually met you.  Besides, of course, there
      is the question of your name.
    %p
      %b> Algernon.
      \  Yes, of course.  [Nervously.]
    %p
      %b> Cecily.
      \  You must not laugh at me, darling, but it
      had always been a girlish dream of mine to love some one whose
      name was #{ernest}.  [
      %b Algernon
      rises,
      %b Cecily
      also.]  There is something in that name that seems to
      inspire absolute confidence.  I pity any poor married woman
      whose husband is not called #{ernest}.
    %p
      %b> Algernon.
      \  But, my dear child, do you mean to say
      you could not love me if I had some other name?
    %p
      %b> Cecily.
      \  But what name?
    %p
      %b> Algernon.
      \  Oh, any name you
      like—Algernon—for instance . . .
    %p
      %b> Cecily.
      \  But I don’t like the name of
      Algernon.
    %p
      %b> Algernon.
      \  Well, my own dear, sweet, loving little
      darling, I really can’t see why you should object to the
      name of Algernon.  It is not at all a bad name.  In
      fact, it is rather an aristocratic name.  Half of the chaps
      who get into the Bankruptcy Court are called Algernon.  But
      seriously, Cecily . . . [Moving to her] . . . if my name was
      Algy, couldn’t you love me?
    %p
      %b> Cecily.
      \  [Rising.]  I might respect you,
      #{ernest}, I might admire your character, but I fear that I should
      not be able to give you my undivided attention.
    %p
      %b> Algernon.
      \  Ahem!  Cecily!  [Picking up
      hat.]  Your Rector here is, I suppose, thoroughly
      experienced in the practice of all the rites and ceremonials of
      the Church?
    %p
      %b> Cecily.
      \  Oh, yes.  Dr. Chasuble is a most
      learned man.  He has never written a single book, so you can
      imagine how much he knows.
    %p
      %b> Algernon.
      \  I must see him at once on a most
      important christening—I mean on most important
      business.
    %p
      %b> Cecily.
      \  Oh!
    %p
      %b> Algernon.
      \  I shan’t be away more than half
      an hour.
    %p
      %b> Cecily.
      \  Considering that we have been engaged
      since February the 14th, and that I only met you to-day for the
      first time, I think it is rather hard that you should leave me
      for so long a period as half an hour.  Couldn’t you
      make it twenty minutes?
    %p
      %b> Algernon.
      \  I’ll be back in no time.
    %p [Kisses her and rushes down the garden.]
    %p
      %b> Cecily.

      his hair so much.  I must enter his proposal in my

      quite like women who are interested in philanthropic work.

      \  Cecily Cardew?  [Moving to her
      and shaking hands.]  What a very sweet name!  Something
      tells me that we are going to be great friends.  I like you
      already more than I can say.  My first impressions of people
      are never wrong.
    %p
      %b> Cecily.
      \  How nice of you to like me so much after
      we have known each other such a comparatively short time. 
      Pray sit down.
    %p
      %b> Gwendolen.
      \  [Still standing up.]  I may call
      you Cecily, may I not?
    %p
      %b> Cecily.
      \  With pleasure!
    %p
      %b> Gwendolen.
      \  And you will always call me Gwendolen,
      won’t you?
    %p
      %b> Cecily.
      \  If you wish.
    %p
      %b> Gwendolen.
      \  Then that is all quite settled, is it
      not?
    %p
      %b> Cecily.
      \  I hope so.  [A pause.  They
      both sit down together.]
    %p
      %b> Gwendolen.
      \  Perhaps this might be a favourable
      opportunity for my mentioning who I am.  My father is Lord
      Bracknell.  You have never heard of papa, I suppose?
    %p
      %b> Cecily.
      \  I don’t think so.
    %p
      %b> Gwendolen.
      \  Outside the family circle, papa, I am
      glad to say, is entirely unknown.  I think that is quite as
      it should be.  The home seems to me to be the proper sphere
      for the man.  And certainly once a man begins to neglect his
      domestic duties he becomes painfully effeminate, does he
      not?  And I don’t like that.  It makes men so
      very attractive.  Cecily, mamma, whose views on education
      are remarkably strict, has brought me up to be extremely
      short-sighted; it is part of her system; so do you mind my
      looking at you through my glasses?
    %p
      %b> Cecily.
      \  Oh! not at all, Gwendolen.  I am
      very fond of being looked at.
    %p
      %b> Gwendolen.
      \  [After examining
      %b Cecily
      carefully through a lorgnette.]  You are here on a short
      visit, I suppose.
    %p
      %b> Cecily.
      \  Oh no!  I live here.
    %p
      %b> Gwendolen.
      \  [Severely.]  Really?  Your
      mother, no doubt, or some female relative of advanced years,
      resides here also?
    %p
      %b> Cecily.
      \  Oh no!  I have no mother, nor, in
      fact, any relations.
    %p
      %b> Gwendolen.
      \  Indeed?
    %p
      %b> Cecily.
      \  My dear guardian, with the assistance of
      Miss Prism, has the arduous task of looking after me.
    %p
      %b> Gwendolen.
      \  Your guardian?
    %p
      %b> Cecily.
      \  Yes, I am Mr. Worthing’s ward.
    %p
      %b> Gwendolen.
      \  Oh!  It is strange he never
      mentioned to me that he had a ward.  How secretive of
      him!  He grows more interesting hourly.  I am not sure,
      however, that the news inspires me with feelings of unmixed
      delight.  [Rising and going to her.]  I am very fond of
      you, Cecily; I have liked you ever since I met you!  But I
      am bound to state that now that I know that you are Mr.
      Worthing’s ward, I cannot help expressing a wish you
      were—well, just a little older than you seem to
      be—and not quite so very alluring in appearance.  In
      fact, if I may speak candidly—
    %p
      %b> Cecily.
      \  Pray do!  I think that whenever one
      has anything unpleasant to say, one should always be quite
      candid.
    %p
      %b> Gwendolen.
      \  Well, to speak with perfect candour,
      Cecily, I wish that you were fully forty-two, and more than
      usually plain for your age.  #{ernest} has a strong upright
      nature.  He is the very soul of truth and honour. 
      Disloyalty would be as impossible to him as deception.  But
      even men of the noblest possible moral character are extremely
      susceptible to the influence of the physical charms of
      others.  Modern, no less than Ancient History, supplies us
      with many most painful examples of what I refer to.  If it
      were not so, indeed, History would be quite unreadable.
    %p
      %b> Cecily.
      \  I beg your pardon, Gwendolen, did you say
      #{ernest}?
    %p
      %b> Gwendolen.
      \  Yes.
    %p
      %b> Cecily.
      \  Oh, but it is not Mr. #{ernest} Worthing who
      is my guardian.  It is his brother—his elder
      brother.
    %p
      %b> Gwendolen.
      \  [Sitting down again.]  #{ernest}
      never mentioned to me that he had a brother.
    %p
      %b> Cecily.
      \  I am sorry to say they have not been on
      good terms for a long time.
    %p
      %b> Gwendolen.
      \  Ah! that accounts for it.  And
      now that I think of it I have never heard any man mention his
      brother.  The subject seems distasteful to most men. 
      Cecily, you have lifted a load from my mind.  I was growing
      almost anxious.  It would have been terrible if any cloud
      had come across a friendship like ours, would it not?  Of
      course you are quite, quite sure that it is not Mr. #{ernest}
      Worthing who is your guardian?
    %p
      %b> Cecily.
      \  Quite sure.  [A pause.]  In
      fact, I am going to be his.
    %p
      %b> Gwendolen.
      \  [Inquiringly.]  I beg your
      pardon?
    %p
      %b> Cecily.
      \  [Rather shy and confidingly.] 
      Dearest Gwendolen, there is no reason why I should make a secret
      of it to you.  Our little county newspaper is sure to
      chronicle the fact next week.  Mr. #{ernest} Worthing and I are
      engaged to be married.
    %p
      %b> Gwendolen.
      \  [Quite politely, rising.]  My
      darling Cecily, I think there must be some slight error. 
      Mr. #{ernest} Worthing is engaged to me.  The announcement will
      appear in the
      %i Morning Post
      on Saturday at the latest.
    %p
      %b> Cecily.
      \  [Very politely, rising.]  I am
      afraid you must be under some misconception.  #{ernest}
      proposed to me exactly ten minutes ago.  [Shows diary.]
    %p
      %b> Gwendolen.
      \  [Examines diary through her lorgnettte
      carefully.]  It is certainly very curious, for he asked me
      to be his wife yesterday afternoon at 5.30.  If you would
      care to verify the incident, pray do so.  [Produces diary of
      her own.]  I never travel without my diary.  One should
      always have something sensational to read in the train.  I
      am so sorry, dear Cecily, if it is any disappointment to you, but
      I am afraid I have the prior claim.
    %p
      %b> Cecily.
      \  It would distress me more than I can tell
      you, dear Gwendolen, if it caused you any mental or physical
      anguish, but I feel bound to point out that since #{ernest} proposed
      to you he clearly has changed his mind.
    %p
      %b> Gwendolen.
      \  [Meditatively.]  If the poor
      fellow has been entrapped into any foolish promise I shall
      consider it my duty to rescue him at once, and with a firm
      hand.
    %p
      %b> Cecily.
      \  [Thoughtfully and sadly.]  Whatever
      unfortunate entanglement my dear boy may have got into, I will
      never reproach him with it after we are married.
    %p
      %b> Gwendolen.
      \  Do you allude to me, Miss Cardew, as
      an entanglement?  You are presumptuous.  On an occasion
      of this kind it becomes more than a moral duty to speak
      one’s mind.  It becomes a pleasure.
    %p
      %b> Cecily.
      \  Do you suggest, Miss Fairfax, that I
      entrapped #{ernest} into an engagement?  How dare you? 
      This is no time for wearing the shallow mask of manners. 
      When I see a spade I call it a spade.
    %p
      %b> Gwendolen.
      \  [Satirically.]  I am glad to say
      that I have never seen a spade.  It is obvious that our
      social spheres have been widely different.

      of one of the hills quite close one can see five counties.

      well-kept garden this is, Miss Cardew.

      anybody manages to exist in the country, if anybody who is
      anybody does.  The country always bores me to death.
    %p

      \  Ah!  This is what the newspapers
      call agricultural depression, is it not?  I believe the
      aristocracy are suffering very much from it just at
      present.  It is almost an epidemic amongst them, I have been
      told.  May I offer you some tea, Miss Fairfax?

      you.  Sugar is not fashionable any more. [

      butter?

      to this young lady?
    %p
      %b> Algernon.
      \  [Looking round.]  To what young
      lady?  Good heavens!  Gwendolen!
    %p
      %b> Cecily.
      \  Yes! to good heavens, Gwendolen, I mean
      to Gwendolen.
    %p
      %b> Algernon.
      \  [Laughing.]  Of course not! 
      What could have put such an idea into your pretty little
      head?

      \  Thank you.  [Presenting her cheek to

      her.]

      \  I felt there was some slight error,
      Miss Cardew.  The gentleman who is now embracing you is my

      one question I would like to be allowed to ask my guardian.
    %p
      %b> Gwendolen.
      \  An admirable idea!  Mr. Worthing,
      there is just one question I would like to be permitted to put to
      you.  Where is your brother #{ernest}?  We are both
      engaged to be married to your brother #{ernest}, so it is a matter
      of some importance to us to know where your brother #{ernest} is at
      present.
    %p
      %b> Jack.
      \  [Slowly and hesitatingly.] 
      Gwendolen—Cecily—it is very painful for me to be
      forced to speak the truth.  It is the first time in my life
      that I have ever been reduced to such a painful position, and I
      am really quite inexperienced in doing anything of the
      kind.  However, I will tell you quite frankly that I have no
      brother #{ernest}.  I have no brother at all.  I never had
      a brother in my life, and I certainly have not the smallest
      intention of ever having one in the future.
    %p
      %b> Cecily.
      \  [Surprised.]  No brother at all?
    %p
      %b> Jack.
      \  [Cheerily.]  None!
    %p
      %b> Gwendolen.
      \  [Severely.]  Had you never a
      brother of any kind?
    %p
      %b> Jack.
      \  [Pleasantly.]  Never.  Not even
      of any kind.
    %p
      %b> Gwendolen.
      \  I am afraid it is quite clear, Cecily,
      that neither of us is engaged to be married to any one.
    %p
      %b> Cecily.
      \  It is not a very pleasant position for a
      young girl suddenly to find herself in.  Is it?
    %p
      %b> Gwendolen.
      \  Let us go into the house.  They
      will hardly venture to come after us there.
    %p
      %b> Cecily.
      \  No, men are so cowardly, aren’t
      they?
    %p [They retire into the house with scornful looks.]
    %p
      %b> Jack.
      \  This ghastly state of things is what you
      call Bunburying, I suppose?
    %p
      %b> Algernon.
      \  Yes, and a perfectly wonderful Bunbury
      it is.  The most wonderful Bunbury I have ever had in my
      life.
    %p
      %b> Jack.
      \  Well, you’ve no right whatsoever to
      Bunbury here.
    %p
      %b> Algernon.
      \  That is absurd.  One has a right
      to Bunbury anywhere one chooses.  Every serious Bunburyist
      knows that.
    %p
      %b> Jack.
      \  Serious Bunburyist!  Good heavens!
    %p
      %b> Algernon.
      \  Well, one must be serious about
      something, if one wants to have any amusement in life.  I
      happen to be serious about Bunburying.  What on earth you
      are serious about I haven’t got the remotest idea. 
      About everything, I should fancy.  You have such an
      absolutely trivial nature.
    %p
      %b> Jack.
      \  Well, the only small satisfaction I have in
      the whole of this wretched business is that your friend Bunbury
      is quite exploded.  You won’t be able to run down to
      the country quite so often as you used to do, dear Algy. 
      And a very good thing too.
    %p
      %b> Algernon.
      \  Your brother is a little off colour,
      isn’t he, dear Jack?  You won’t be able to
      disappear to London quite so frequently as your wicked custom
      was.  And not a bad thing either.
    %p
      %b> Jack.
      \  As for your conduct towards Miss Cardew, I
      must say that your taking in a sweet, simple, innocent girl like
      that is quite inexcusable.  To say nothing of the fact that
      she is my ward.
    %p
      %b> Algernon.
      \  I can see no possible defence at all
      for your deceiving a brilliant, clever, thoroughly experienced
      young lady like Miss Fairfax.  To say nothing of the fact
      that she is my cousin.
    %p
      %b> Jack.
      \  I wanted to be engaged to Gwendolen, that
      is all.  I love her.
    %p
      %b> Algernon.
      \  Well, I simply wanted to be engaged to
      Cecily.  I adore her.
    %p
      %b> Jack.
      \  There is certainly no chance of your
      marrying Miss Cardew.
    %p
      %b> Algernon.
      \  I don’t think there is much
      likelihood, Jack, of you and Miss Fairfax being united.
    %p
      %b> Jack.
      \  Well, that is no business of yours.
    %p
      %b> Algernon.
      \  If it was my business, I wouldn’t
      talk about it.  [Begins to eat muffins.]  It is very
      vulgar to talk about one’s business.  Only people like
      stock-brokers do that, and then merely at dinner parties.
    %p
      %b> Jack.
      \  How can you sit there, calmly eating
      muffins when we are in this horrible trouble, I can’t make
      out.  You seem to me to be perfectly heartless.
    %p
      %b> Algernon.
      \  Well, I can’t eat muffins in an
      agitated manner.  The butter would probably get on my
      cuffs.  One should always eat muffins quite calmly.  It
      is the only way to eat them.
    %p
      %b> Jack.
      \  I say it’s perfectly heartless your
      eating muffins at all, under the circumstances.
    %p
      %b> Algernon.
      \  When I am in trouble, eating is the
      only thing that consoles me.  Indeed, when I am in really
      great trouble, as any one who knows me intimately will tell you,
      I refuse everything except food and drink.  At the present
      moment I am eating muffins because I am unhappy.  Besides, I
      am particularly fond of muffins.  [Rising.]
    %p
      %b> Jack.
      \  [Rising.]  Well, that is no reason why
      you should eat them all in that greedy way. [Takes muffins from

        %b Algernon
    %p
      %b> Algernon.
      \  [Offering tea-cake.]  I wish you
      would have tea-cake instead.  I don’t like
      tea-cake.
    %p
      %b> Jack.
      \  Good heavens!  I suppose a man may eat
      his own muffins in his own garden.
    %p
      %b> Algernon.
      \  But you have just said it was perfectly
      heartless to eat muffins.
    %p
      %b> Jack.
      \  I said it was perfectly heartless of you,
      under the circumstances.  That is a very different
      thing.
    %p
      %b> Algernon.
      \  That may be.  But the muffins are
      the same.  [He seizes the muffin-dish from
      = succeed ".]" do
        %b Jack
    %p
      %b> Jack.
      \  Algy, I wish to goodness you would go.
    %p
      %b> Algernon.
      \  You can’t possibly ask me to go
      without having some dinner.  It’s absurd.  I
      never go without my dinner.  No one ever does, except
      vegetarians and people like that.  Besides I have just made
      arrangements with Dr. Chasuble to be christened at a quarter to
      six under the name of #{ernest}.
    %p
      %b> Jack.
      \  My dear fellow, the sooner you give up that
      nonsense the better.  I made arrangements this morning with
      Dr. Chasuble to be christened myself at 5.30, and I naturally
      will take the name of #{ernest}.  Gwendolen would wish
      it.  We can’t both be christened #{ernest}. 
      It’s absurd.  Besides, I have a perfect right to be
      christened if I like.  There is no evidence at all that I
      have ever been christened by anybody.  I should think it
      extremely probable I never was, and so does Dr. Chasuble. 
      It is entirely different in your case.  You have been
      christened already.
    %p
      %b> Algernon.
      \  Yes, but I have not been christened for
      years.
    %p
      %b> Jack.
      \  Yes, but you have been christened. 
      That is the important thing.
    %p
      %b> Algernon.
      \  Quite so.  So I know my
      constitution can stand it.  If you are not quite sure about
      your ever having been christened, I must say I think it rather
      dangerous your venturing on it now.  It might make you very
      unwell.  You can hardly have forgotten that some one very
      closely connected with you was very nearly carried off this week
      in Paris by a severe chill.
    %p
      %b> Jack.
      \  Yes, but you said yourself that a severe
      chill was not hereditary.
    %p
      %b> Algernon.
      \  It usen’t to be, I know—but
      I daresay it is now.  Science is always making wonderful
      improvements in things.
    %p
      %b> Jack.
      \  [Picking up the muffin-dish.]  Oh,
      that is nonsense; you are always talking nonsense.
    %p
      %b> Algernon.
      \  Jack, you are at the muffins
      again!  I wish you wouldn’t.  There are only two
      left.  [Takes them.]  I told you I was particularly
      fond of muffins.
    %p
      %b> Jack.
      \  But I hate tea-cake.
    %p
      %b> Algernon.
      \  Why on earth then do you allow tea-cake
      to be served up for your guests?  What ideas you have of
      hospitality!
    %p
      %b> Jack.
      \  Algernon!  I have already told you to
      go.  I don’t want you here.  Why don’t you
      go!
    %p

      brother?

      \  I don’t.  But that does not
      affect the wonderful beauty of his answer.
    %p
      %b> Gwendolen.
      \  True.  In matters of grave
      importance, style, not sincerity is the vital thing.  Mr.
      Worthing, what explanation can you offer to me for pretending to
      have a brother?  Was it in order that you might have an
      opportunity of coming up to town to see me as often as
      possible?
    %p

      exploded.
    %p
      %b> Lady Bracknell.
      \  Exploded!  Was he the victim
      of a revolutionary outrage?  I was not aware that Mr.
      Bunbury was interested in social legislation.  If so, he is
      well punished for his morbidity.
    %p
      %b> Algernon.
      \  My dear Aunt Augusta, I mean he was
      found out!  The doctors found out that Bunbury could not
      live, that is what I mean—so Bunbury died.
    %p
      %b> Lady Bracknell.
      \  He seems to have had great
      confidence in the opinion of his physicians.  I am glad,
      however, that he made up his mind at the last to some definite
      course of action, and acted under proper medical advice. 
      And now that we have finally got rid of this Mr. Bunbury, may I
      ask, Mr. Worthing, who is that young person whose hand my nephew
      Algernon is now holding in what seems to me a peculiarly
      unnecessary manner?
    %p
      %b> Jack.
      \  That lady is Miss Cecily Cardew, my
      ward.  [

        %b Cecily

      %b> Algernon.
      \  I am engaged to be married to Cecily,
      Aunt Augusta.
    %p
      %b> Lady Bracknell.
      \  I beg your pardon?
    %p
      %b> Cecily.
      \  Mr. Moncrieff and I are engaged to be
      married, Lady Bracknell.
    %p
      %b> Lady Bracknell.
      \  [With a shiver, crossing to the
      sofa and sitting down.]  I do not know whether there is
      anything peculiarly exciting in the air of this particular part
      of Hertfordshire, but the number of engagements that go on seems
      to me considerably above the proper average that statistics have
      laid down for our guidance.  I think some preliminary
      inquiry on my part would not be out of place.  Mr. Worthing,
      is Miss Cardew at all connected with any of the larger railway
      stations in London?  I merely desire information. 
      Until yesterday I had no idea that there were any families or
      persons whose origin was a Terminus.  [
      %b Jack
      looks
      perfectly furious, but restrains himself.]
    %p
      %b> Jack.
      \  [In a clear, cold voice.]  Miss Cardew
      is the grand-daughter of the late Mr. Thomas Cardew of 149
      Belgrave Square, S.W.; Gervase Park, Dorking, Surrey; and the
      Sporran, Fifeshire, N.B.
    %p
      %b> Lady Bracknell.
      \  That sounds not
      unsatisfactory.  Three addresses always inspire confidence,
      even in tradesmen.  But what proof have I of their
      authenticity?
    %p
      %b> Jack.
      \  I have carefully preserved the Court Guides
      of the period.  They are open to your inspection, Lady
      Bracknell.
    %p
      %b> Lady Bracknell.
      \  [Grimly.]  I have known
      strange errors in that publication.
    %p
      %b> Jack.
      \  Miss Cardew’s family solicitors are
      Messrs. Markby, Markby, and Markby.
    %p
      %b> Lady Bracknell.
      \  Markby, Markby, and Markby? 
      A firm of the very highest position in their profession. 
      Indeed I am told that one of the Mr. Markby’s is
      occasionally to be seen at dinner parties.  So far I am
      satisfied.
    %p
      %b> Jack.
      \  [Very irritably.]  How extremely kind
      of you, Lady Bracknell!  I have also in my possession, you
      will be pleased to hear, certificates of Miss Cardew’s
      birth, baptism, whooping cough, registration, vaccination,
      confirmation, and the measles; both the German and the English
      variety.
    %p
      %b> Lady Bracknell.
      \  Ah! A life crowded with incident,
      I see; though perhaps somewhat too exciting for a young
      girl.  I am not myself in favour of premature
      experiences.  [Rises, looks at her watch.]  Gwendolen!
      the time approaches for our departure.  We have not a moment
      to lose.  As a matter of form, Mr. Worthing, I had better
      ask you if Miss Cardew has any little fortune?
    %p
      %b> Jack.
      \  Oh! about a hundred and thirty thousand
      pounds in the Funds.  That is all.  Goodbye, Lady
      Bracknell.  So pleased to have seen you.
    %p
      %b> Lady Bracknell.
      \  [Sitting down again.]  A
      moment, Mr. Worthing.  A hundred and thirty thousand
      pounds!  And in the Funds!  Miss Cardew seems to me a
      most attractive young lady, now that I look at her.  Few
      girls of the present day have any really solid qualities, any of
      the qualities that last, and improve with time.  We live, I
      regret to say, in an age of surfaces.  [To

      your hair seems almost as Nature might have left it.  But we
      can soon alter all that.  A thoroughly experienced French
      maid produces a really marvellous result in a very brief space of
      time.  I remember recommending one to young Lady Lancing,
      and after three months her own husband did not know her.

      Yes, quite as I expected.  There are distinct social

      age are its want of principle and its want of profile.  The
      chin a little higher, dear.  Style largely depends on the
      way the chin is worn.  They are worn very high, just at
      present.  Algernon!

      prettiest girl in the whole world.  And I don’t care
      twopence about social possibilities.

      \  Never speak disrespectfully of
      Society, Algernon.  Only people who can’t get into it

      \  Thank you, Aunt Augusta.
    %p
      %b> Lady Bracknell.
      \  The marriage, I think, had better
      take place quite soon.
    %p
      %b> Algernon.
      \  Thank you, Aunt Augusta.
    %p
      %b> Cecily.
      \  Thank you, Aunt Augusta.
    %p
      %b> Lady Bracknell.
      \  To speak frankly, I am not in
      favour of long engagements.  They give people the
      opportunity of finding out each other’s character before
      marriage, which I think is never advisable.
    %p
      %b> Jack.
      \  I beg your pardon for interrupting you,
      Lady Bracknell, but this engagement is quite out of the
      question.  I am Miss Cardew’s guardian, and she cannot
      marry without my consent until she comes of age.  That
      consent I absolutely decline to give.
    %p
      %b> Lady Bracknell.
      \  Upon what grounds may I
      ask?  Algernon is an extremely, I may almost say an
      ostentatiously, eligible young man.  He has nothing, but he
      looks everything.  What more can one desire?
    %p
      %b> Jack.
      \  It pains me very much to have to speak
      frankly to you, Lady Bracknell, about your nephew, but the fact
      is that I do not approve at all of his moral character.  I
      suspect him of being untruthful.  [
      %b Algernon
      and
      %b Cecily
      look at him in indignant amazement.]
    %p
      %b> Lady Bracknell.
      \  Untruthful!  My nephew
      Algernon?  Impossible!  He is an Oxonian.
    %p
      %b> Jack.
      \  I fear there can be no possible doubt about
      the matter.  This afternoon during my temporary absence in
      London on an important question of romance, he obtained admission
      to my house by means of the false pretence of being my
      brother.  Under an assumed name he drank, I’ve just
      been informed by my butler, an entire pint bottle of my
      Perrier-Jouet, Brut, ’89; wine I was specially reserving
      for myself.  Continuing his disgraceful deception, he
      succeeded in the course of the afternoon in alienating the
      affections of my only ward.  He subsequently stayed to tea,
      and devoured every single muffin.  And what makes his
      conduct all the more heartless is, that he was perfectly well
      aware from the first that I have no brother, that I never had a
      brother, and that I don’t intend to have a brother, not
      even of any kind.  I distinctly told him so myself yesterday
      afternoon.
    %p
      %b> Lady Bracknell.
      \  Ahem!  Mr. Worthing, after
      careful consideration I have decided entirely to overlook my
      nephew’s conduct to you.
    %p
      %b> Jack.
      \  That is very generous of you, Lady
      Bracknell.  My own decision, however, is unalterable. 
      I decline to give my consent.

      %b> Lady Bracknell.
      \  [To
      = succeed ".]\u{a0}" do

      goes over.]  How old
      are you, dear?
    %p
      %b> Cecily.
      \  Well, I am really only eighteen, but I
      always admit to twenty when I go to evening parties.
    %p
      %b> Lady Bracknell.
      \  You are perfectly right in making
      some slight alteration.  Indeed, no woman should ever be
      quite accurate about her age.  It looks so calculating . . .
      [In a meditative manner.]  Eighteen, but admitting to twenty
      at evening parties.  Well, it will not be very long before
      you are of age and free from the restraints of tutelage.  So
      I don’t think your guardian’s consent is, after all,
      a matter of any importance.
    %p
      %b> Jack.
      \  Pray excuse me, Lady Bracknell, for
      interrupting you again, but it is only fair to tell you that
      according to the terms of her grandfather’s will Miss
      Cardew does not come legally of age till she is thirty-five.
    %p
      %b> Lady Bracknell.
      \  That does not seem to me to be a
      grave objection.  Thirty-five is a very attractive
      age.  London society is full of women of the very highest
      birth who have, of their own free choice, remained thirty-five
      for years.  Lady Dumbleton is an instance in point.  To
      my own knowledge she has been thirty-five ever since she arrived
      at the age of forty, which was many years ago now.  I see no
      reason why our dear Cecily should not be even still more
      attractive at the age you mention than she is at present. 
      There will be a large accumulation of property.
    %p
      %b> Cecily.
      \  Algy, could you wait for me till I was
      thirty-five?
    %p
      %b> Algernon.
      \  Of course I could, Cecily.  You
      know I could.
    %p
      %b> Cecily.
      \  Yes, I felt it instinctively, but I
      couldn’t wait all that time.  I hate waiting even five
      minutes for anybody.  It always makes me rather cross. 
      I am not punctual myself, I know, but I do like punctuality in
      others, and waiting, even to be married, is quite out of the
      question.
    %p
      %b> Algernon.
      \  Then what is to be done, Cecily?
    %p
      %b> Cecily.
      \  I don’t know, Mr. Moncrieff.
    %p
      %b> Lady Bracknell.
      \  My dear Mr. Worthing, as Miss
      Cardew states positively that she cannot wait till she is
      thirty-five—a remark which I am bound to say seems to me to
      show a somewhat impatient nature—I would beg of you to
      reconsider your decision.
    %p
      %b> Jack.
      \  But my dear Lady Bracknell, the matter is
      entirely in your own hands.  The moment you consent to my
      marriage with Gwendolen, I will most gladly allow your nephew to
      form an alliance with my ward.
    %p
      %b> Lady Bracknell.
      \  [Rising and drawing herself
      up.]  You must be quite aware that what you propose is out
      of the question.
    %p
      %b> Jack.
      \  Then a passionate celibacy is all that any
      of us can look forward to.
    %p
      %b> Lady Bracknell.
      \  That is not the destiny I propose
      for Gwendolen.  Algernon, of course, can choose for
      himself.  [Pulls out her watch.]  Come, dear,
      [
      %b Gwendolen

      of my unpublished sermons.  However, as your present mood
      seems to be one peculiarly secular, I will return to the church

      Twenty-eight years ago, Prism, you left Lord Bracknell’s
      house, Number 104, Upper Grosvenor Street, in charge of a
      perambulator that contained a baby of the male sex.  You
      never returned.  A few weeks later, through the elaborate
      investigations of the Metropolitan police, the perambulator was
      discovered at midnight, standing by itself in a remote corner of
      Bayswater.  It contained the manuscript of a three-volume
      novel of more than usually revolting sentimentality. 
      [

      the baby was not there!  [Every one looks at

      \  Lady Bracknell, I admit with shame
      that I do not know.  I only wish I did.  The plain
      facts of the case are these.  On the morning of the day you
      mention, a day that is for ever branded on my memory, I prepared
      as usual to take the baby out in its perambulator.  I had
      also with me a somewhat old, but capacious hand-bag in which I
      had intended to place the manuscript of a work of fiction that I
      had written during my few unoccupied hours.  In a moment of
      mental abstraction, for which I never can forgive myself, I
      deposited the manuscript in the basinette, and placed the baby in
      the hand-bag.

      importance to me.  I insist on knowing where you deposited
      the hand-bag that contained that infant.

      \  Your guardian has a very emotional
      nature.

      %b> Lady Bracknell.
      \  This noise is extremely
      unpleasant.  It sounds as if he was having an
      argument.  I dislike arguments of any kind.  They are
      always vulgar, and often convincing.
    %p
      %b> Chasuble.
      \  [Looking up.]  It has stopped
      now.  [The noise is redoubled.]
    %p
      %b> Lady Bracknell.
      \  I wish he would arrive at some
      conclusion.
    %p
      %b> Gwendolen.
      \  This suspense is terrible.  I
      hope it will last.  [Enter
      %b Jack
      with a hand-bag of
      black leather in his hand.]

      \  [Calmly.]  It seems to be
      mine.  Yes, here is the injury it received through the
      upsetting of a Gower Street omnibus in younger and happier
      days.  Here is the stain on the lining caused by the
      explosion of a temperance beverage, an incident that occurred at
      Leamington.  And here, on the lock, are my initials.  I
      had forgotten that in an extravagant mood I had had them placed
      there.  The bag is undoubtedly mine.  I am delighted to
      have it so unexpectedly restored to me.  It has been a great
      inconvenience being without it all these years.
    %p
      %b> Jack.
      \  [In a pathetic voice.]  Miss Prism,
      more is restored to you than this hand-bag.  I was the baby
      you placed in it.
    %p
      %b> Miss Prism.
      \  [Amazed.]  You?
    %p
      %b> Jack.
      \  [Embracing her.]  Yes . . .
      mother!
    %p
      %b> Miss Prism.
      \  [Recoiling in indignant
      astonishment.]  Mr. Worthing!  I am unmarried!
    %p
      %b> Jack.
      \  Unmarried!  I do not deny that is a
      serious blow.  But after all, who has the right to cast a
      stone against one who has suffered?  Cannot repentance wipe
      out an act of folly?  Why should there be one law for men,
      and another for women?  Mother, I forgive you.  [Tries
      to embrace her again.]
    %p
      %b> Miss Prism.
      \  [Still more indignant.]  Mr.
      Worthing, there is some error.  [Pointing to

      \  [After a pause.]  Lady Bracknell, I
      hate to seem inquisitive, but would you kindly inform me who I
      am?
    %p
      %b> Lady Bracknell.
      \  I am afraid that the news I have
      to give you will not altogether please you.  You are the son
      of my poor sister, Mrs. Moncrieff, and consequently
      Algernon’s elder brother.
    %p
      %b> Jack.
      \  Algy’s elder brother!  Then I
      have a brother after all.  I knew I had a brother!  I
      always said I had a brother!  Cecily,—how could you
      have ever doubted that I had a brother?  [Seizes hold of
      = succeed ".]\u{a0}" do
        %b Algernon
    %p
      %b> Algernon.
      \  Well, not till to-day, old boy, I
      admit.  I did my best, however, though I was out of
      practice.
    %p [Shakes hands.]
    %p
      %b> Gwendolen.
      \  [To
      = succeed ".]\u{a0}" do
        %b Jack
    %p
      %b> Jack.
      \  Good heavens! . . . I had quite forgotten
      that point.  Your decision on the subject of my name is
      irrevocable, I suppose?
    %p
      %b> Gwendolen.
      \  I never change, except in my
      affections.
    %p
      %b> Cecily.
      \  What a noble nature you have,
      Gwendolen!
    %p
      %b> Jack.
      \  Then the question had better be cleared up
      at once.  Aunt Augusta, a moment.  At the time when
      Miss Prism left me in the hand-bag, had I been christened
      already?
    %p
      %b> Lady Bracknell.
      \  Every luxury that money could
      buy, including christening, had been lavished on you by your fond
      and doting parents.
    %p
      %b> Jack.
      \  Then I was christened!  That is
      settled.  Now, what name was I given?  Let me know the
      worst.
    %p
      %b> Lady Bracknell.
      \  Being the eldest son you were
      naturally christened after your father.
    %p
      %b> Jack.
      \  [Irritably.]  Yes, but what was my
      father’s Christian name?
    %p
      %b> Lady Bracknell.
      \  [Meditatively.]  I cannot at
      the present moment recall what the General’s Christian name
      was.  But I have no doubt he had one.  He was
      eccentric, I admit.  But only in later years.  And that
      was the result of the Indian climate, and marriage, and
      indigestion, and other things of that kind.
    %p
      %b> Jack.
      \  Algy!  Can’t you recollect what
      our father’s Christian name was?
    %p
      %b> Algernon.
      \  My dear boy, we were never even on
      speaking terms.  He died before I was a year old.
    %p
      %b> Jack.
      \  His name would appear in the Army Lists of
      the period, I suppose, Aunt Augusta?
    %p
      %b> Lady Bracknell.
      \  The General was essentially a man
      of peace, except in his domestic life.  But I have no doubt
      his name would appear in any military directory.
    %p
      %b> Jack.
      \  The Army Lists of the last forty years are
      here.  These delightful records should have been my constant
      study.  [Rushes to bookcase and tears the books out.] 
      M. Generals . . . Mallam, Maxbohm, Magley, what ghastly names
      they have—Markby, Migsby, Mobbs, Moncrieff! 
      Lieutenant 1840, Captain, Lieutenant-Colonel, Colonel, General
      1869, Christian names, #{ernest} John.  [Puts book very quietly
      down and speaks quite calmly.]  I always told you,
      Gwendolen, my name was #{ernest}, didn’t I?  Well, it is
      #{ernest} after all.  I mean it naturally is #{ernest}.
    %p
      %b> Lady Bracknell.
      \  Yes, I remember now that the
      General was called #{ernest}, I knew I had some particular reason
      for disliking the name.
    %p
      %b> Gwendolen.
      \  #{ernest}!  My own #{ernest}!  I
      felt from the first that you could have no other name!
    %p
      %b> Jack.
      \  Gwendolen, it is a terrible thing for a man
      to find out suddenly that all his life he has been speaking
      nothing but the truth.  Can you forgive me?
    %p
      %b> Gwendolen.
      \  I can.  For I feel that you are
      sure to change.
    %p
      %b> Jack.
      \  My own one!

      %b> Chasuble.

      Frederick!  At last!

      \  Cecily!  [Embraces her.]  At
      last!

      \  Gwendolen!  [Embraces her.]  At
      last!
    %p
      %b> Lady Bracknell.
      \  My nephew, you seem to be
      displaying signs of triviality.
    %p
      %b> Jack.
      \  On the contrary, Aunt Augusta, I’ve
      now realised for the first time in my life the vital Importance
      of Being #{ernest}.
